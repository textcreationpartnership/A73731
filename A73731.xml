            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>And I beleue alſo and profeſſe that god the father, whiche to the fyrſte perſon in Trinitie, is not onely the god, the lorde, and the father of heuen and erth, and all thynges conteyned therin by creation and gouernaunce: but alſo that he is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his onely begotten ſonne, the ſeconde perſone in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that he dyd bygette hym of his owne ſubſtaunce by eternall generation, that is to ſaye, by generation that neuer hadde begynnynge.</p>
               <p>And I beleue alſo, and profeſſe that all and ſynguler the wordes and ſayinges of this god the father (be they lawes, preceptes, promyſes, prophycyes, or thretenynges) and all that euer was ſpoken of hym, or by hym in the hole body and canon of the newe and the olde teſtament, is moſte certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trewe, and of ſuche infallyble verytie and trouthe, that the ſame canne not be altered, or conuelled by any contrary opynyon, power, or auctorytie.

               <p>This maner of belefe we oughte to haue in no creature of god be it neuer ſo excellent, but in god onely, and therfore in this crede, the ſayde maner of ſpeakynge is vſed onely in the thre Artycles, whiche concerne the thre perſons in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that is to ſay, the father, the ſonne, and the holy gooſt.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:173220:25"/> all ryghtuouſe, all voyde and pure from ſynne, and vtterly free and clere from the yocke and power of the dyuell: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it ordeyned by god, that this chylde Ieſu Chriſte, ſhulde be ſo conceyued and borne, as was ſayde before.

               <p>It is alſo to be noted in this Article, that the victory and conqueſte, whiche Chriſte hadde ouer deathe, hell, and the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hym ſelfe, with all theyr power and tyranny, beſyde that it proceded of the infinite mercy and goodnes of god towardes vs, it was alſo founded vpon veray Iuſtyce. For ſurely like as the ſinne of man, &amp; his diſobedience, was the only meane and cauſe, wherfore god ordeyned and ſuffred, that deth, and the dyuel, ſhuld haue and occupy ſuche dominion &amp; tyrranny ouer all mankynde, as they had: Euen ſo was it contrary to the wyll and ordynaunce of god, that dethe, hell, or the dyuell ſhulde haue or exercyſe any power or auctoritie, where as no ſynne reygned. In ſo moche that yf man had neuer ſynned, he
<pb facs="tcp:173220:26"/> ſhulde neuer haue dyed, but ſhulde haue ben immortall, nor neuer ſhulde haue deſcended into helle, but ſhulde euer haue had the ſuperyoritie ouer the dyuell, deathe, and helle, and ſhulde haue had theym alwayes ſubdewed vnto hym. And therfore ſythe the dyuell hym ſelfe dyd perfytely knowe, that our ſauyour Ieſu Chriſte, expreſſed in all his lyfe mooſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte, and mooſte perfyte obedyence vnto the lawes, and wyll of god, and ſoo fulfylled and ſatyſfyed the ſame in euerye poynte, to the vttermoſt, that there coulde neuer be founde vntrewthe, or deceyte in his mouthe, nor any ſpotte or blotte of fylthyneſſe or impuritie, in any parte of all his lyuynge, and yet that not withſtandynge (knowynge hym to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray naturalle manne) laboured, procured, and cauſed the Iewes to kylle this innocente Chriſte, and to put hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mooſte ſharpe and bytter deathe, contrarye to all equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Iuſtyce, and all to the intente that he myghte after his ſayde deathe, haue Chriſte with hym downe into helle, as one of his captyues, and ſo there to exercyſe his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye vppon hym, lyke as he hadde doone ouer all other men, from the begynnynge of the worlde, vntyll that tyme: No doubte, but the dyuelle in this doynge, dydde extreme and manyfeſte wronge, and vtterly exceded the lymyttes of the power gyuen vnto hym.

               </p>
               <p>¶In the .vi. Article thre thynges be ſpeciallye to be noted, and remembred. Fyrſte, that in the perſon of Ieſu Chriſte, there was and is conioyned, and vnited togyther inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bothe the nature of god, and the nature of manne.</p>
               <p>And that by reaſon of this indiſſoluble vnitie of theſe two natures, holye ſcrypture vſeth ſometymes to attrybute and gyue vnto the ſame perſonne of Chriſte thoſe thynges, whiche doo apperteygne vnto his humanytie, althoughe the ſame canne not be veryfyed in hym, as towchynge his godheed. And therfore althowghe Chriſte, as towchynge his godheed, was euer preſente in heuen, and was euer equall in glorye with his father: Yet foraſmoche as concernynge his manhode he was neuer in heuen, nor dydde neuer ſytte there endewed with ſuche power and glorye before this his aſcenſcyon: therfore it is ſayde trewely in this Crede, that Chriſte aſcended into heuen, and that almyghtye god the father dydde, at his ſayde commynge thyther, ſette hym there vppon his ryght hande. </p>
               <p>¶ Secondely, it is to be noted, that this aſcenſion of Chriſte into heuen was not onely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray neceſſarye: but alſo moche profytable for all trewe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten men, and that for many cauſes: One is, for that Chriſte declared therby veray manyfeſtely, that he was nat onely manne, but that he was alſo veray god. And therfore hir foloweth in this Artycle, He ſytteth on the ryght hande of his father, not as inferiour in godheed, but as equall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym. An other is, for that he hath ben euer ſyth that tyme our contynuall aduocate &amp; ſollicitour vnto god his father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the ſayinge of ſaynt Paule,<note place="margin">Hebr. iiii.</note> wrytynge vnto the Hebrues, where he ſayth in this maner, Chriſte aſcended into heuen, to thintent he ſhuld euer appere, &amp; euer be preſent in the ſyght of god, as a mediator, and interceſſor for vs. And in an other place alſo he faythe, Ieſus the ſonne of god dyd pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate &amp; aſcende aboue all the heuens to be our great byſhop.
<pb facs="tcp:173220:27"/> wherfore let vs fermely and ſtedfaſtely beleue, that we haue a great byſhoppe in heuen, that is to ſaye, a greate, and a perpetuall medyatour and interceſſour for vs. And that the ſame our byſhoppe is not onely of ſuche infynyte myght and power, that he is fully hable to ſaue all them that woll inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and byleue in god the father by hym: but alſo that he hauyng perfyte knowlege of all the infyrmities of our fleſhe and mortalitie, and hauyng taſted by experience in his owne body all the tentacions of the ſame (ſynne onely excepted) he woll alſo gladly and wyllyngely haue pitie and compaſſion of vs, and woll be alwayes redy to ſaue vs. Wherfore lette vs put our hole truſte and confydence in hym. And ſo let vs boldely goo by prayer, and inuocation vnto the throne of grace, that we maye obteyne mercy, and fynde grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, helpe, ſuccour, and comfort in tyme of our nede, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. And Sayncte Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle alſo wryteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely here vnto in his fyrſte Epyſtle, where he ſayth, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte and praye you good chriſten people,<note place="margin">i. Ioan. ii</note> flee from ſynne, and ſynne no more. Not withſtandynge yf any of you ſhall fortune to commytte any deadely ſynne, yet let hym conſider and remembre, that Ieſu Chriſte, whiche fulfylled al Iuſtice for vs, and by the ſacrifienge, and offerynge vp of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe bloude, made due ſatiſfaction, and propiciation vnto god his father, not onely for all our ſynnes, but alſo for the ſynnes of all the worlde: is nowe our continuall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall aduocate, our patrone and defendour before the throne of his father, and maketh contynuall interceſſion and prayer for the remyſſyon of all our ſynnes.</p>
               <p>An other cauſe is for that yf Chriſte had not aſcended, we ſhuld haue lacked all the graces and gyftes of the holy gooſt, whiche be neceſſary for the paſſynge of this tranſytorie lyfe, to the pleaſure of god, and to thatteynynge of euerlaſtynge lyfe in an other worlde, accordynge to the ſayinge of Chriſte, ſpekyng vnto his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Ioan. vi.</note> in this maner, I tel you trouth, it is expediente, and neceſſarie for you, that I ſhall aſcende

For ſurely yf I ſhulde not aſcende, the holy gooſt ſhall neuer come vnto you: and contrary yf I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende into heuen, than woll I ſende hym immedyately vnto you. And whan the ſayde holy gooſte ſhall come, than ſhall he reproue, and condempne the worlde, and the dyuel for their ſynne and iniquitie, and he ſhall fully inſtructe and teache you all trouthe. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thyrdely it is to be noted, that all thoughe it be ſayde in this Artycle, that Chriſte is our onely mediatour and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, yet therby is not excluded the interceſſion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayntes, whiche be nowe in heuen, or hereafter ſhall be: neyther yet the interceſſion of the mynyſters of Chriſtis chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, or of any the holy membres of the ſame, whiche be liuing here in this worlde.

               <p>¶In the .vii. artycle it is to be noted, that lyke as the worlde had ones a begynnyng, ſo ſhall it ones alſo haue an endyng.<note place="margin">The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the vii. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</note> And that vpon the ſame extreme or laſte daye of the worlde, Chriſte ſhall come with glorie, as the ſupreme &amp; higheſt iuge, and ſhall holde an vnyuerſall or generall iugement, in the whiche all the people of the worlde, that euer was, or euer ſhall be, ſhall appere before hym, there to receyue theyr fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſentence and iugement, ſome of euerlaſtynge ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome of perpetuall dampnation.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be noted, that this artycle was for great conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations added immedyately, and conioyned vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Artycles, ſpecyally to thintent that no man ſhulde in his lyfe tyme preſume vpon the ſayde benefytes of Chriſte, or take occaſyon of carnalle lybertie or ſecuritie, and ſoo lyue
<pb facs="tcp:173220:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> withoute hauynge any feare to tranſgreſſe, or regarde to obſerue the commaundementes of god: but rather that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good chriſten man ſhulde in euery parte of his lyfe haue a contynuall remembraunce, and reſpecte vnto that laſte daye of iudgement, and ſo be in contynuall feare, to commyt any thynge contrarye to the wyll of god, for the whiche he myght deſerue to haue the ſentence of euerlaſtynge dampnation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vpon hym. For this is certaynely true, that at that day euery man ſhalbe called to make a ſtrayt accompt of his lyfe, and ſhall be than fynally iudged euen accordynge to his owne propre workes, good or badde, done in his lyfe tyme. That is to ſaye, yf in his lyfe tyme he dyd beleue in his harte, and profeſſe with his mouthe, the ryghte belefe and faythe of Chriſte, and accordynge vnto the ſame fayth dyd expreſſe in his outwarde workes ſuche obedience vnto the lawes of god, as he requireth: he ſhall be iudged to haue euerlaſtynge lyfe for his rewarde. And contrary, yf in his lyfe tyme he hadde not this ryghte faythe, and beliefe in Chriſte, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge oportunitie, dyd not expreſſe this obedience, but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the lawes of god, and ſo dyed without repentaunce, althoughe he pretended and ſayde, that he beleued neuer ſo moche, and truſted in Chriſtis benefyttes neuer ſo moche, yet ſhall he be iudged and condempned to the euerlaſtynge peynes of helle.</p>
               <p>In this Article it is further to be noted, that lyke as there is nothynge more certayne vnto vs, than that we be all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and ſhall ones dye, &amp; yet no man lyuynge knoweth the tyme, whan he ſhall dye: Euen ſo there is nothynge more certayne, thanne that this daye of iudgemente ſhall ones come, and yet the howre and the tyme whan it ſhall be, is hydden and kepte ſecrete from the knowlege of all men and Angelles, and is reſeued to the onely knowlege of god. whiche thynge procedeth of his onely goodneſſe towardes vs, and is done to thyntente we ſhulde alwayes here in our lyfe tyme, fle from ſynne, and employe al our hole ſtudy, and

               <p>It is alſo to be noted in this Artycle,<note place="margin">Ma xxiiii Mar. xiii Luc. xvii.</note> that lyke as the lyghtenynge commeth from heuen ſodeynely vnloked fore, and in one inſtaunte, or momente caſteth lyght ouer all: euen ſo this ſeconde aduente or commynge of Chryſte, and his generall iudgement ſhall come ſodeynly, and at ſuche tyme as the greatteſt parte of the people of the worlde ſhall feare or loke for nothynge leſſe than for that daye.

And ſome interpretours do deuyde the ſayde clauſe from the .ix. Artycle, and do conioyne it with the Artycle that foloweth, that is to ſay, Remyſſyon of ſynnes. Nowe theſe doctours, whiche be of this opinion, do alſo dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſely expounde the ſayde clauſe of communyon of Sayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.

And for as moche as by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the ſacrament of the Altare, we be inſerted in to the body of Chriſte, and ſo we be incorporated in Chryſte, and Chriſte in vs: therfore ſome interpretours doo take, that by this clauſe is ſygnifyed, the Sacramente of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare. And ſome doctours do expounde it to ſygnifye that treaſour of the churche, whiche is commune equally vnto all the membres of the ſame. And thoſe doctours, whiche be of this opynion, do interpretate that treaſoure to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge els, but the grace, that is to ſaye, the mercye, the goodneſſe, and the fauour of god in this worlde, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye in the worlde to come. They ſaye alſo that this grace of god, is the commune treaſour of all the electe people of god, and that our pouertie is ſo extreme, that of our ſelfes, without this grace, we ſhulde be vtterly nothynge. They ſaye further, that the effecte and vertue of this grace is, to make vs hable to ryſe from ſynne, and flee from ſynne, to worke good workes, to receyue the rewarde of euerlaſtynge glorye, to haue and reteyne the trewe ſenſe and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of holy ſcrypture, and to endewe vs with chriſten faythe, hope, and charitie. Fynally they ſay, that this grace worketh all thoſe effectes in the electe people of god, by two ſpecyall Inſtrumentes, whiche be, the worde of God and his ſacramentes. And for as moche as bothe the worde and the Sacramentes haue all theyr effycacye by, and thoroughe the myghte and operation of the holy gooſte, and for as moche alſo as this holy gooſte, dwelleth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydeth onely in the Catholyque churche, and in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the ſame, and worketh none of theſe effectes oute of the churche, they thynke that by this clauſe, Communion of Saynctes, is mente here the treaſoure of the Churche: And that this treaſoure is nothynge elles, but the holy gooſte hym ſelfe, and his graces, wherby and by the worde of god and his Sacramentes we atteygne remyſſyon of ſynnes,

               <p>In this Artycle, it is alſo to be noted, that remyſſyon of ſynnes is the fynall cauſe of all the hole hyſtorie of Chriſte, and of all the workes that euer he dydde, or ſuffered for out ſakes, and our redemption, and alſo the ſpecyalle fruyte and profyte, whiche trewe chryſten men doo receyue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For ſurelye Chriſte became man, and was borne, crucyfyed, deade, and roſe agayne to lyfe, and aſcended to heuen, to the ende and entente to meryte and deſerue for vs remyſſyon of all our ſynnes, for aſmoche as hit was impoſſyble for vs to haue obteyned the ſame, by any other meanes.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173220:35"/> is the verye ſelfe thynge, whiche was prophecyed, ſyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfyed, and repreſented by the other coniunction of man and woman in maryage. For thoughe Sayncte Paule vſed in this place other argumentes and perſuaſyons, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the lawe of Nature, to induce maried perſones, the one to loue the other (ſayinge, that menne naturally do loue and nouryſſhe theyr owne bodyes, and theyr owne fleſſhe: and that it is agaynſte nature, that a manne ſhulde hate his owne fleſſhe) yet ſurely he thoughte, that this was the reaſon of mooſte effycacye, to perſwade his ſayde purpoſe, That is to ſaye, that all huſbandes and wyues oughte ſo to vſe theym ſelfes, the one vnto the other, that theyr Matrymonye, and all theyr workes and affections in the ſame, myghte and ſhoulde correſponde, and be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lyke in all poyntes vnto that moſt holy thynge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is ſygnyfied and repreſented therby, that is to ſaye, vnto that ſpirituall coniunction, whiche is betwene Chriſte and his eſpouſe the churche.

And vnderſtande you alſo, that it is not laufull for any man to ſeparate, and to dyuyde thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones a ſondre, whiche be by goddis worde, and his wyll and power, conioyned together. And whan the Phariſeys, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge therunto ſayd, And why than dyd Moyſes commaund vs to make a libell of dyuorce agaynſte our wyfes, for what cauſe ſo euer we wolde, and ſo departe &amp; ſeparate our ſelfes from them? Chriſte anſwered them agayne and ſayde, Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173220:36"/> conſyderynge the induratenes and obſtinacye of youre hartes, was contente to permytte and ſuffre you ſo to doo, for auoydynge of greatter myſchefe and inconuenience, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che myght els haue enſued therof: All be it I ſaye vnto you, that it was not ſo at the begynnynge, that is to ſaye, It is clene contrary to the godly inſtitution, &amp; naturall order &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of Matrimonie, as it was inſtituted by god at the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, that any man maryed ſhulde dyuorce hym ſelfe from his laufull wyfe. And therfore I ſaye agayne vnto you, that who ſo euer dothe forſake his laufull wyfe, oneleſſe it be for adulterie commytted by her, and dothe marye a nother, I ſaye, he commytteth adulterie in his ſo doynge. And lyke wyſe, what woman ſo euer doth forſake her laufull huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and marie an other, ſhe alſo commytteth adulterie. And the man alſo that marieth her, offendeth in lyke maner. And the cauſe hereof is, for that the bonde of laufull mariage is of ſuche ſorte, that it can not be dyſſolued, or broken, but by deathe onely.</p>
               <p>Theſe wordes of Chriſte euidentely declare Chriſtis ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the approbation of the inſtitution of Matrimonie, made at the begynnynge of the worlde: And that hit was Chriſtis wylle and comamundemente, that all the people of god ſhoulde folowe and conforme theyr doynges vnto the lawes of Matrimonye than made, and ſhoulde obſerue the ſame in ſuche puretie and ſanctimonie, as it was fyrſte or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned, without ſeparation or dyuorce, and that vnder the peyne of dampnation.</p>
               <p>And here alſo two thinges ſpecially be to be noted. The one is in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſte ſayth, whom god conioyneth, man can not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate. By the which wordes he declareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infinite benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and goodnes of god towardes vs, in that, that he hath not onely conioyned our fyrſte progenitours Adam and Eue togyther in mariage, wherby he gaue vnto vs the originall begynnynge of our procreation: but that he dothe alſo euer ſithe that tyme contynually aſſiſte man and woman, and
<pb facs="tcp:173220:37"/> worketh with them in this coniunction of mariage, and as you wolde ſaye, is the veray auctour, cauſer, and doer of all Matrimonies, whiche be laufully contracted betwene man and woman. The other thynge to be noted is, in that Chriſte ſaith here vnto his dyſciples, <hi>Non omnes capiunt verbum hoc: ſed quibus datum eſt, qui poteſt capere capiat.</hi> By the whiche wordes Chryſte ſemeth to exhorte ſuche as he ſhall endue with the grace and vertue of continence, wherby they ſhall be hable to abſteyne from the workes of Matrimonie, to contynewe ſole and vnmaryed.</p>
               <p>¶Item we thynke it conueniente, that all byſſhops and preachers ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commytted vnto theyr ſpirituall charge, that the ſacrament of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie dothe conſyſte of two partes, lyke as the other ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes do, that is to ſaye, of an outwarde and a vyſible ſygne, and of an inward and an inuiſible grace. The outward ſigne is that outwarde contracte, made by expreſſe wordes or other ſygnes equiualent, declarynge the conſente betwene ſuche perſones, as maye laufully and by thorder of goddis lawe, be ioyned togyther in maryage, whanne the ſame perſones do conſent and promyſe eche to other, to companye together continually, durynge theyr lyues, without ſeparation, and to communicate eche to other the vſe and office of theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all other theyr faculties and ſubſtaunce. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and inuiſible graces, whiche the electe people of god (as well in the tyme of the lawe of nature, as in the tyme of Moyſes ſawe, and alſo in the tyme of the newe teſtamente,) dyd alwaies, and yet do receyue by vertue of this ſacrament, be dyuers and ſondrye. Wherof one is the diſpenſation, or grace of god, wherby the acte of procreation betwene man and woman, whiche is (as of it ſelfe. and of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) dampable, is ſanctified by the worde of god and this ſaramente, that is to ſaye, is made pure, cleane, withoute ſpotte of ſynne,<note place="margin">Hebr. xiii.</note> and honourable, accordynge to the ſayenge of ſaynt Paule, <hi>Honorabile coniugium i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omnibus, &amp; thorus imacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus.</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:173220:37"/> That is to ſaye, the acte of procreation betwene man and woman in Matrimonie is honourable, and acceptable afore god, and their bed is vndefyled. And other is the grace, wherby the perſones conioyned in Matrimonie do atteyne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtynge lyfe, yf they brynge vp theyr chyldren in the true fayth and obſeruance of Chryſtis religion, accordynge to the wordes of ſaynt Paule, where he ſayth,<note place="margin">i. Tim. ii.</note> The woman was ſeduced and blynded by the ſerpent, and ſo ſynned deedly: but ſhe ſhall be ſaued by procreation and bryngyng forthe of chyldren, yf the ſame do perſeuer and contynue in fayth and loue towardes god, and in holynes, and in temperance in theyr outwarde actes and dedes. And as this is ſpoken of the woman, ſo it is alſo to be verified in the man, he doinge lykewyſe as is required of the woman.</p>
               <p>¶Finally we thinke it conuenient, that all byſhoppes and preachers, ſhall diligentely and from tyme to tyme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte and admonyſhe the people, commytted vnto theyr ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall charge, to conſider the thre ſpecial benefites or offices, whiche belonge vnto the ſacrament of matrimony. And fyrſt of all to conſyder the thynge ſelfe, whiche is ſignified ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, whiche (as was ſayd before) is the high, the mighty, and the incomprehenſyle worke of god, in the coniunction of Chryſte and the churche togyther, wroughte by hym to our ſyngular benefyte and euerlaſting ſaluation. And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the man and wyfe oughte not onely to lyue together in perfyte vnitie and concorde: but alſo they ought to loue eche other as theyr owne bodyes, and to vſe the ſame in all clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, puretie, and honour, and not to defyle the ſame with the rages and luſtes of any beaſtely or fylthy concupiſcence of the fleſhe, euen as Chryſte hym ſelfe loued, and doth loue his eſpouſe the churche, and ſuffred all afflictions and pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to make her glorious, and voyde from all maner of ſpot or wryncle of vncleannes. And in this parte alſo it ſhall be well done, that the byſhoppes and preachers do repete ofte tymes, and laye before the eyes of the people, as welle the
<pb facs="tcp:173220:38"/> ſayenges of ſaynte Paule before reherſed, as alſo the godly exhortation, which he maketh in his epiſtle vnto the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniens,<note place="margin">i. The. iiii</note> where he writeth in this maner. I pray you brethern and inſtantly deſyre you for our lord Ieſu Chriſtis ſake, that lyke as you haue herde heretofore of vs, howe and in what maner you ſhulde go forwarde and pleaſe god: ſo ye do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede in the ſame, and that after ſuche ſorte and maner, that you may contynually profyte and increaſe therin. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre, I doubt not, what preceptes and commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes I haue gyuen vnto you in tymes paſte, in the name of our lorde Ieſu Chriſte. And nowe in lyke maner, and in his name alſo, I ſaye agayne vnto you, that the wyll and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente of god is, that you ſhulde ſanctifie your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, that is to ſaye, that you ſhulde abſteyne frome all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fornication, and that euerye oone of you ſhoulde vſe and kepe the veſſelle of his bodye, in holyneſſe and in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, and not in deſyre of carnalle concupyſcence, lyke as the gentyles do, whiche knowe not god. And that noo man ſhulde craftely compaſſe or cyrcumuent his brother in fleſſhly luſtes. For almyghty god taketh vengeaunce vpon all ſuche people, as do commytte any of thoſe thynges. Know you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that god hath not called vs vnto vnclenlyneſſe and fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe of lyfe, but vnto holyneſſe and ſanctimonye. And therfore I do exhorte you all, and in the name of god com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde you, to eſchewe all fornication and adulterie, all vncleane deſyres, and carnall concupyſcence, al filthines and vnpure lyuynge in fleſſhely luſtes of the body. And I ſaye further, that who ſo euer deſpyſeth and breketh theſe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes: dothe not deſpyſe me, but he deſpyſethe god, for they be his commaundementes, whoſe ſpirite bothe you and I haue receyued.</p>
               <p>Theſe wordes of ſayncte Paule be neceſſary to be declared ofte tymes to the people, to the intent they maye the better knowe the wyll and commaundement of god, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydre and feare the greate daunger of goddes wrothe and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173220:38"/> vengeaunce, dewe vnto ſuche people, as do tranſgreſſe the godly inſtitution and lawes of this holy ſacrament of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonye.</p>
               <p>¶The ſeconde ſpecyalle gyfte or benefyte to be conſidered in the ſayde ſacrament, is the faythe and mutuall promyſe made betwene the huſbande and the wyfe ioyned in laufulle Matrimonye. Whereby, and by vertue of the ſayde ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the perſons ſo laufully conioyned, be bounde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue certayn truſte and confidence, and certaynly to beleue, not only that theyr ſayd ſtate and maner of lyuynge in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke (beinge the ſame vertuouſely, and religiouſely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the lawe of god by them contracted and obſerued) is honourable, acceptable, and meritorious before god: but alſo that the knotte and bonde of Matrimonye contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the ſayde perſones, is made therby to be indiſſoluble.</p>
               <p>Trouth it is, that yf in any mariage it may appere, and be duely proued, that there is ſuche laufull impedimente, that the ſame myght not at the begynnyng be contracted by thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the lawes of god and holy churche: In that caſe the churche ought and may diuorce the ſayd perſons ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and declare that ſuche Matrimonie is vnlaufulle, and the bonde therof to be of no ſtrengthe or efficacie, bycauſe it was neuer good from the begynnynge. Notwithſtandynge in mariages laufully made, and accordinge to the ordynance of Matrimonye preſcribed by god and holye Churche, the bonde therof can by no meanes be diſſolued, durynge the lyues of the partyes, betwene whome ſuche matrimonye is contracted.</p>
               <p>And in this parte alſo the people be to be taught, that who ſo euer goethe about to dyſſeuer hym ſelfe from the bonde of laufull mariage, he goeth about ſo moche as in hym lyeth, to diuorce Chriſte from his churche.</p>
               <p>The thyrde ſpecial gyft or office to be conſidered &amp; obſerued in Matrimonye, is the good and vertuous education and bryngynge vp of the chyldern begoten in the ſame. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

               <p>Seconde we thynke it conuenyent, that all byſſhops and preachers, ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commytted vnto their ſpirituall charge, that the ſacramente of orders, may worthyly be called a ſacrament, bycauſe it is a holy rite
<pb facs="tcp:173220:46"/> or ceremonye inſtituted by Chriſte and his apoſtelles in the newe teſtament, and dothe conſyſte of two partes, lyke as the other ſacramentes of the churche do, that is to ſaye, of a ſpirituall and an inuiſible grace, and alſo of an outwarde and a viſible ſigne. The inuiſible gyfte or grace conferred in this ſacrament, is nothynge els, but the power, the office, and the auctorytie before mencyoned. The viſible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſygne is the prayer and impoſition of the byſſhoppes handes vpon the perſon, whiche receyueth the ſayde gyfte or grace. And to the intente the churche of Chriſte ſhulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be deſtituted of ſuche myniſters, as ſhulde haue and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſayde power of the keyes: it was alſo ordeyned and commaunded by the apoſtels, that the ſame ſacrament ſhulde be applyed and adminiſtred by the byſſhoppe frome tyme to tyme, vnto ſuche other perſones as had the qualities neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryly required ther vnto. whiche ſayde qualities the apoſtels dyd alſo very diligently deſcriue, as it appereth euidentlye in the .iii.<note place="margin">i. Tim. iii Titum. i.</note> chapiter of the fyrſte epiſtle of ſaynct Paule to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe, and the fyrſte chapiter of his epiſtle vnto Titus. And ſurely this is the hole vertue and efficacie, and the cauſe alſo of the inſtitution of this ſacrament, as it is founded in the newe teſtament. For all be it the holy fathers of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, whiche ſucceded the apſtoles (myndynge to beautyfie and ornate the Churche of Chriſte with all thoſe thynges, which were commendable in the temple of the Iewes) dyd deuyſe, not onely certayne other ceremonies than be before reherſed, as tonſures, raſures, vnctions, and ſuche other obſeruances, to be vſed in the miniſtration of the ſayde ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but dyd alſo inſtitute certayne inferiour orders or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as ianitours, lectours, exorciſtes, accolites, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and deputed to euery one of thoſe certayne offices to execute in the churche (wherin they folowed vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the example and rytes vſed in the olde teſtamente) yet the trouthe is, that in the newe teſtamente there is no mention made of any degrees or diſtinctions in ordres, but onely of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173220:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> deacons or miniſters, and of prieſtes or byſſhops. Nor there is any worde ſpoken of any other ceremony vſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrynge of this ſacrament: but onely of prayer and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the byſſhops handes.</p>
               <p>Thyrdely foraſmoche as it is an olde hereſy of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, condempned in generalle counceylles, to thynke that the worde of god and his ſacramentes ſhulde loſe and be of none efficacie, ſtrengthe, or vertue, when they be miniſtred by men of yuell, viciouſe, and fylthy lyuynge: we thynke it conuenient, that all byſſhops and preachers, ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted vnto theyr ſpyrytuall charge, that accordynge to the ſaying of ſayncte Gregorie Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene, Lyke as there is no dyfference betwene the ſelfe ſame i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or fygure of any thynge enprynted with a ſygnette of golde, and with a ſygnette made of yron or wodde, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vyler matter: euen ſo the worde and ſacramentes of god, mynyſtred by any euyll and noughtie man, be of the ſame ſelfe vigour, ſtrength, and efficacie, as when they be miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by a man of excellente vertue and goodnes. The cauſe and reaſon wherof is, for that the prieſtes and byſſhoppes, all thoughe in the execution of theyr offyce and miniſtration they do vſe and exercyſe the power and auctorytie of god commytted vnto theym, and doo ſupplye and repreſente his towme and place: yet they be not the pryncipall, nor the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or efficient cauſers or gyuers of grace, or of any other ſpyrytuall gyfte, whiche procedeth, and is gyuen of god by his worde and his ſacramentes. but god is the onely princy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, ſufficiente, and perfyte cauſe of all the efficacie of his worde and ſacramentes and by his onely power, grace, and benefyte, it is, that we receyue the holy gooſt and his gracis by thoffyce and miniſtration of the ſayde prieſtes or byſſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. And the ſayde prieſtes or byſſhoppes be but onely as his inſtrumentes or officers, to execute and miniſter with theyr handes and tongues, the outewarde and corporall thynges, wherby god worketh &amp; gyueth grace accordynge to his pacte
<pb facs="tcp:173220:47"/> and couenaunt, made with, and vnto his eſpouſe the churche. And this to be true Chriſoſtome affirmeth,<note place="margin">Chriſoſto Ho. lxxxv ſuꝑ Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> in his .85. homelie vpon ſaint Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where he ſayth in this maner. what ſpeke I of prieſtes? I ſay that neither angel nor arcangel can of his owne power gyue vs any of thoſe thynges, whiche be gyuen vnto vs from god, but it is the father, the ſonne, and the holy gooſte, whiche is the effectuall cauſe of all thoſe thynges, The prieſte dothe onely put to his hande and his tongue. And in this poynte ſayncte Ambroſe alſo agreeth with the ſayde opinion of Chriſoſtome. For in his boke <hi>De dignitate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotali,</hi> he ſaythe theſe wordes: The prieſt layeth his handes vpon vs, but it is god that gyueth the grace. The prieſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth vppon vs his beſechynge hande: but god bleſſethe vs with his myghty hande. The byſhoppe conſecrateth an no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther byſſhoppe: but it is god that gyueth the dygnitie. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt alwayes thynke, &amp; beleue that the vertue &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the worde of god &amp; his ſacramentes, conſyſte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende in and vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, ordynaunce, power, and auctoritie of god onely. And that neyther the merytes and worthynes of the miniſters, (be they neuer of ſuche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie) do gyue them theyr auctoritie, ſtrength, or efficacie: neyther yet the malyce or corrupte lyuynge of them (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo yuell, onles they be open blaſphemors of the goſpell, as the iewes and the Turkes be) can fruſtrate or take away from the ſayde worde or ſacramentes theyr ſayde power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie,<note place="margin">Chriſoſto Ho. lxxxv ſuꝑ Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> ſtrength, or vertue. For as Chriſoſtome ſayth in the ſaid homelie, Yf god made not only an aſſe to ſpeke, but alſo gaue his benediction &amp; bleſſynge vpon the iewes by Balaam that falſe and wycked prophete, &amp; ſo wrought theſe ſpirituall graces by ſuche vncleane &amp; impure inſtrumentes, and that for the loue onely, whiche he had vnto the Iewes, whiche neuer the leſſe were great offenders agaynſt god: no doubte but that god woll moche rather ſende downe vnto vs his faythfull people, the graces of his holy ſpirite, and wol worke all other thynges neceſſarie for vs by our prieſtes and byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173220:47"/> althoughe they be neuer ſo euyll of theyr lyuynge.</p>
               <p>Fourthely for aſmoche as after the mynde of certayne doctours of the churche this hoole power and auctoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longynge vnto prieſtes and byſſhoppes, is deuyded in two partes, wherof the one is called <hi>Poteſtas ordinis,</hi> and the other is called, <hi>Poteſtas iuriſdictionis.</hi> and for aſmoche alſo as good conſent and agrement hath alwaye ben in the churche, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge the ſayde fyrſte parte, and contrary, moche contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie for this other parte of iuriſdiction: we thynke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that all byſſhoppes and preachers ſhall inſtruct and teache the people, commytted vnto theyr ſpiritual charge, that the iuriſdiction commytted vnto prieſtes and byſſhoppes by thauctorite of goddes lawe, conſiſteth in thre ſpecial pointes.</p>
               <p>The fyrſte is to rebuke and reprehende ſinne, and to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the manifeſte and obſtinate ſinners, that is to ſay, to ſeparate, exclude, and repelle from the communion and perception of the ſacramentes, and to reiecte and caſte out of the congregation and company of Chriſtis people ſuche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as haue manifeſtly commytted mortall ſynne, and do obſtinately perſeuer in the ſame, and to abſoyle and receyue them agayne, whan ſo euer they ſhall returne vnto the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by condigne penaunce. And foraſmoche as ſuche perſones as do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytte manifeſt and open ſinne, do therby offend not only god but alſo ſome other of the multitude and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, whiche they be of: although the ſaide perſones ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge publikely, do not obſtinatly perſeuer in their ſynne ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted, yet the prieſtes and byſſhops, by thauctorite of their ſayd Iuriſdiction, maye in ſome caſes, vppon conſyderation of the crime, and qualitie of the perſonne ſo offendynge, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpende and inhibite theym for a tyme from the receyuynge of the ſacramentes, to the intente the ſame maye be, not onely a medicine to the offenders them ſelfes: but alſo an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſatiſfaction vnto thoſe perſones, whiche were before with theyr ſayde manifeſt ſynnes offended.</p>
               <p>And in this parte alſo twoo thynges be to be noted.
<pb facs="tcp:173220:48"/> The fyrſte is that all punyſſhemente, whiche prieſtes or byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes maye by thauctoritie of the goſpell inflicte or put to any perſone, is by worde onely, and not by any violence or conſtraynte corporall. The ſeconde is, that all thoughe prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis and byſſhoppes haue the power and iuriſdiction to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, as is aforeſayde: yet they be not bounde ſoo preciſely by any commaundement of god, but that they ought and maye attempre, moderate, or forbeare the execution of theyr ſayde iuriſdiction in that parte at all tymes, whan ſo euer they ſhall perceyue and thynke, that by doinge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they ſhulde not cure or helpe thoffenders, or elles gyue ſuche occaſion of further trouble &amp; vnquyetnes in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, that the peace and tranquillitie therof myght therby be impeched, troubled, or otherwyſe interrupted, or broken.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde poynt, wherin conſyſteth the iuryſdyction, commytted vnto prieſtes and byſſhoppes by thauctoritie of goddis lawe, is to approue and admytte ſuche perſones, as (beinge nominated, elected, and preſented vnto them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſe thoffyce and rome of preachynge the goſpell, and of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſtrynge the ſacramentes, and to haue the cure or iuryſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ouer theſe certayn people within this pariſſhe, or within this dioceſſe) ſhall be thought vnto them mete and worthy to exercyſe the ſame: and to reiecte and repelle from the ſayde rowme ſuche as they ſhall iudge to be vnmete therfore. And in this parte we muſt knowe and vnderſtande, that the ſayd preſentation and nomination is of mannes ordinaunce, and apperteyneth vnto the founders and patrones, or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, accordynge to the lawes and ordynaunces of men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the ſame. As for an example, within this realme the preſentation and nomination of the byſſhopryques ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth vnto the kynges of this realme, and of other leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer cures and perſonages ſomme vnto the kynges hyghnes, ſome vnto other noble men, ſome vnto byſſhoppes, and ſome vnto other perſones, whome we calle the patrones of the benefyces, accordynge as it is prouyded by the order of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173220:48"/> lawes and ordynaunces of this realme. And vnto the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes or byſſhoppes belongeth by the auctoritie of the goſpel, to approue and confirme the perſone, whiche ſhall be by the kynges highnes, or the other patrons ſo nominated, elected, and preſented vnto theym to haue the cure of theſe certayne people, within this certayne paryſhe or dioceſe, or els to reiect hym, as was ſayde before, from the ſame, for his demerites or vnworthynes. For ſurely the office of preachynge is the chiefe and moſte principall office, wherunto prieſtes or byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes be called by thauctoritie of the goſpell. and they be alſo called byſſhoppes or archebyſhops, that is to ſaye, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attendantes or ouerſeers ſpecially to ſygnifie, that it is theyr office to ouerſe, to watche, and to loke diligently vpon theyr flocke. and to cauſe that Chriſtis doctrine and his religion may be truely and ſincerely conſerued, taught, and ſet forthe amonge chriſten people, accordynge to the mere and pure trouthe of ſcrypture. and that all erroniouſe and corrupte doctrine, and the teachers therof maye be reiected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected accordyngely.</p>
               <p>The thyrde poynt wherin conſiſtethe the iuriſdiction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted vnto prieſtes and byſſhops by the auctoritie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis lawe, is to make and ordeyne certayne rules or canons, concernynge holydays, faſtynge dayes, the maner and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to be vſed in the miniſtration of the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, the maner of ſyngynge the Pſalmes and ſpiritualle hymnes,<note place="margin">Ephe. v. Coll. iii.</note> (as fayncte Paule calleth theym) the diuerſitie of degrees amonge the miniſters, and the forme and maner of theyr ornamentes, and fynally concernynge ſuche other rites ceremonies and obſeruaunces, as do tende and conduce to the preſeruation of quietnes and decent order to be had, and vſed amonge the people, whan they ſhall be aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the temple. For ſyth that ſcripture commaundeth, that all chriſten people, ſhulde at certayne tymes aſſemble them ſelfe, and conuene together in ſome publique or open place, there to inuocate, and calle vpon the name of god, there to
<pb facs="tcp:173220:49"/> here his wyll and his worde by our preachers, thereto receyue the Sacramentes, there to gyue laude and prayſe to god in pſalmodie, in prayers, in medytations, and in redynge. and fynally with all humilitie and reuerent ordre, to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, extoll, and ſet forth the honour of god with all our poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power. And for aſmoche alſo as great trouble, vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and tumulte myghte aryſe amonge the multytude ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, in caſe there were no certayne rules, ordynaunces, and ceremonies preſcribed vnto them, wherby they ſhulde be conteyned in quietnes, and not ſuffered to do euery man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne faſhion or appetite: it belongeth vnto the iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of prieſtes or byſſhoppes, to make certayne rules or canons, concernynge all theſe thynges, and for the cauſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd. For lyke as in the gouernance of a priuate familie, or in the gouernance of a ſchole, it belongeth vnto the good man, or ruler of that houſe, or the ſchole maiſter to preſcribe the tymes, whan his chylderne and ſeruauntes ſhall worke, whan they ſhall reſt, whan they ſhall lerne, whan they ſhall praye, and ſuche other thynges: So in the publique &amp; open temple or churche, it apperteyneth alſo vnto them, that haue the gouernance of the churche, in thoſe poyntes to deuiſe and preſcribe ſuche neceſſarie and conuenient ceremonies and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denaunces vnto the people, for the cauſes aboue reherſed, as ſhall tende to theyr profyte and increaſe in Chriſtis reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſhall alſo tende to the honoure of god, and good tranquillitie of the ſaid people. For ſurely ſaynct Paule hym ſelfe dyd preſcribe,<note place="margin">i. Cor. xi.</note> and make ſuche rules vnto the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and commanded alſo other byſſhops to do the ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And the holy fathers of the churche at the begynnynge, before there were any chriſten princis, vpon great and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conſiderations, dyd ordeyne the celebratynge of the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, of Eaſter daye, and certayne other feaſtes, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge of lent, and alſo diuers other ſuche cerimonies in the churche, wherof a great parte is obſerued through all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome vnto this daye. The contynualle obſeruation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173220:49"/> wherof was alwayes thought vnto the holy fathers very neceſſarie: for aſmoche as ſuche traditions, and ceremonies be as a certayne neceſſarie introduction, or lernynge expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to induce and teache the people reuerentely to vſe them ſelfe in theyr outwarde worſhyppynge of god, and be alſo (as you wolde ſay) certayne peynted hyſtories, the often ſight &amp; contemplation wherof, cauſeth the people the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre the thynges ſygnified, and repreſented in the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the better declaration of which thre pointes, two thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be to be noted, Fyrſt that althoughe the hole Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on apperteynynge (as is afore ſayde) vnto prieſtes and byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, be commited vnto them in generall wordes (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth by dyuers places of ſcripture, and ſpecyally in the .xx. chapiter of thactes, where thapoſtle ſayth:<note place="margin">Act. xx.</note> Take dylygent hede to your ſelfes, &amp; to al your hole flocke, amonges whom the holy gooſt hath ſet, ordeyned, and made you byſſhoppes, to rule, &amp; gouerne the churche of god) Yet there is alſo a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler order, fourme, and maner requiſite to the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame accordynge to the ſayinge of ſayncte Paule,<note place="margin">i. Co. xiiii</note> Loke that all thynges be done in the churche ſemely and in a decent order. Nowe this particular maner &amp; fourme is not expreſſely declared, determyned, or preſcribed in ſcripture: but was, and is lefte to be declared frome tyme to tyme, and from age to age by certayne poſitiue rules and ordynaunces, to be made by the miniſters of the churche, with the conſent of the people, before ſuche tyme as prynces were chryſtened. and after they were chriſtened, with thauctoritie and conſent of the ſayde princis and their people. For lyke as thauctoritie to preache and teache, and to adminyſter the ſacramentes, althoughe it be commytted vnto prieſtis and byſſhops by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes of ſcripture, yet there is no expreſſe mention concernynge the particuler circumſtances, conuenient to be vſed in the execution of the ſame: Euen ſo in the power of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, althoughe the ſame be by general wordes in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commytted vnto prieſtes and byſſhoppes, yet there is no
<pb facs="tcp:173220:50"/> particuler mention, what fourme, order, or proceſſe ſhulde be vſed in thexecution of any parte therof. As for an example concernynge the ſentence of excommunication, although the cognicion of crymes, for the whiche the ſayd ſentence is to be gyuen, and thexamination of the wytnes alſo neceſſarye for the triall of the crymes, and for the inſtruction of hym, that ſhall gyue the ſayd ſentence, be commytted by generall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ſcrypture vnto prieſtes and byſſhoppes: yet there is no mention made in ſcrypture, howe the parties offendyng, or the wytneſſe ſhall be cited and called to appere before the prieſtes or byſſhoppes. nor there is no mencion made, what proceſſe or peyne ſhall be vſed agaynſte them, in caſe any of them ſhall diſobeye the callynge or ſentence of the prieſte, or byſſhoppe. nor fynally there is any mention made of any other circumſtaunce of tyme, place, or perſone neceſſarie to be vſed in the due execution of the ſayde ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. But all theſe thynges were afterwarde deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ordeyned by the churche, and the mynyſters of the ſame, and by the conſent of thoſe people, whiche profeſſed the name of Chriſte. And that this is of trouth, it appereth by ſuche ordinaunces, as ſayncte Paule hym ſelfe, and other thapoſtles deuyſed, and preſcrybed to be obſerued in certayne churches, as well concernynge the excommunicatynge of the Corinthian,<note place="margin">1 Cor. v. 1. Tim. i, 1. Cor. xii. 1 Co. xiiii. 1 Co. xvi.</note> and dyuers others, as alſo concernyng, that men ſhulde praye bare heeded, that women ſhulde kepe ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and not take vpon them to teache in the churche, that two prophetes or preachers ſhulde not ſpeake at one tyme in the churche, but that one ſhulde gyue place to the other, that the almes of poore men ſhulde be gathered, and howe and by whom, after it was gathered, it ſhuld be dyſtributed, with ſuche other lyke thynges. And this thynge alſo appereth to be true, by the canons and rules, deuyſed and made by the byſſhoppes and councelles, concernynge the premyſſes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge the tyme that the churche was ſubiecte to infidel pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and before any pryncis were chriſtened.

Trouthe it is, that prieſtes and byſſhops may execute all ſuche temporal power and iuriſdiction, as is committed vnto them, by the ordinance and auctoritie of kynges or other ciuile powers, and by the conſent of the people (as officers and minyſters vnder the ſayd kynges &amp; powers) ſo longe as it ſhall pleaſe the ſayd kynges and people to permitte and ſuffre them ſo to vſe and execute the ſame.

<pb facs="tcp:173220:53"/> or matters, whiche apperteigne vnto kynges and the cyuyle powers, and theyr courtes, and wyll maynteyne or thynke, that he may ſo do by thauctoritie of Chriſte and his goſpell, although the kynges and pryncis wolde not permytte and ſuffre hym ſo to doo: No doubte that byſſhoppe is not worthy to be called a byſſhoppe, but rather a tyranne, and an vſurper of other mens rightes, contrary to the lawes of god, and is worthye to be reputed none otherwyſe, than he that gothe aboute to ſubuerte the kyngedome of Chriſte. For the kyngedome of Chriſte in his churche is a ſpirituall and not a carnall kyngdome of the worlde, that is to ſaye, the veray kyngedome, that Chriſte by hym ſelfe, or by his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels and diſciples ſought here in this worlde, was to brynge all nations frome the carnalle kyngedome of the prynce of darkenes, vnto the lyght of his ſpirituall kyngedome: and ſo to reigne hym ſelfe in the hartes of people by grace, faith, hope, and charitie. And therfore, ſyth Chriſte dyd neuer ſeke nor exerciſe any worldly kyngedome or domynion in this worlde, but rather refuſynge and fleynge from the ſame, dyd leaue the ſayd worldly gouernance of kyngdomes, realmes, and nations to be gouerned by pryncis and potentatis (in lyke maner as he dyd fynd them) and commanded alſo his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtels and diſciples to do the ſemblable, as it was ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: what ſo euer prieſte or byſſhoppe wyll arrogate or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume vpon hym any ſuche auctoritie, and woll pretende the auctoritie of the goſpell for his defenſe therin, he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els, but in maner (as you wold ſay) crowneth Chriſte agayne with a crowne of thorne, and traduceth and bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth hym forthe agayne with his mantell of purpure vppon his backe, to be mocked and ſcorned of the worlde, as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes dyd, to theyr owne damnation.</p>
               <p>¶More ouer, the trouthe is, that God conſtituted, and ordeyned thauctoritie of chriſten kynges and pryncis, to be the mooſte hyghe and ſupreme aboue all other powers and offices in the regiment and gouernaunce of his people: And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173220:53"/> commytted vnto them, as vnto the chiefe heades of theyr common welthes, the cure and ouerſyght of all the people, whiche be within theyr realmes and dominions, withoute any exception. And vnto them of ryght, and by goddes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement belongeth, not onely to prohybite vnlaufull violence, to correcte offenders by corporall deathe, or other punyſhment, to conſerue morall honeſtie amonge their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, accordynge to the lawes of their realmes, to defende Iuſtice, and to procure the publike weale, and the commen peace and tranquillitie in outwarde and erthly thinges: but ſpecially and princypally to defende the fayth of Chriſte and his relygion, to conſerue and mainteyne the true doctrine of Chriſte, &amp; all ſuche as be true preachers &amp; fetters forth therof, and to abolyſhe all abuſes, hereſies, and idolatries, whiche be brought in, by heretiques and yuell preachers, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe with corporall paynes ſuche as of malice be occaſioners of the ſame, and fynally to ouer ſe, and cauſe that the ſayde prieſtes and byſhoppes do execute theyr ſayde power, office, and iuriſdyction truely, faythefully, and accordynge in all poyntes as it was gyuen and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted vnto them by Chriſt and his apoſtles.

And therfore it apperteyneth vnto Chriſten kynges and princes, for the dyſcharge of theyr office and duetie towardes god, to endeuoure them ſelfe, to refourme and reduce the ſame agayne vnto the olde lymyttes and priſtine ſtate of that power and iuriſdiction, which was gyuen vnto them by Chriſte, and vſed in the primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. For it is out of all doubte, that Chriſtis faith was than moſte firme and pure, &amp; the ſcriptures of god were than beſt vnderſtanded, and vertue dyd than moſte habounde and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. And therfore it muſte nedes folowe, that the cuſtomes and ordynaunces than vſed and made, muſte nedes be more conforme and agreable vnto the true doctrine of Chriſte, and more conducyng to the edifieng and benefyte of the churche of Chriſt, than any cuſtomes or lawes vſed or made ſyth that tyme.

Surely we haue great cauſe moſte ioyfully and thankefully to embrace and accepte the ſame, conſyderynge that therby no preiudice is done to goddis worde or his ordyaunces.

               <p>Thyrdly, howe that the holy fathers of the churche, conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derynge this place of ſaynt Iames, and the maner alſo of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noyntynge of ſycke men, vſed by the apoſtels (as was afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayd) thought it conuenient to inſtitute and ordeyn, that this maner of anoyling of ſicke men, preſcrybed by ſaint Iames, ſhulde be obſerued contynually in the churche of Chriſte, as a very godly and holſome medicine, or remedye to alleuiate and mitigate the diſeaſes &amp; maladies, as well of the ſoule as of the body of chriſten men. And to the intente the ſame ſhuld be had in more honour and veneration, the ſayd holy fathers willed &amp; taught, that all chriſten men ſhuld repute &amp; accompt the ſayd maner of anoylinge amonge thother ſacramentes of the churche, for aſmoche as it is a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace. Wherof the viſible ſigne is the anoylynge with oyle in the name of god: whiche oyle (for the naturall propreties belonginge vnto the ſame) is a very conuenient thyng to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and fygure the great mercy and grace of god, and the ſpirituall lyght, ioy, comfort, &amp; gladneſſe, whiche god pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out vpon all faithfull people, callyng vpon hym, by the inwarde vnction of the holy gooſt.

This grace we be aſſured to opteyne by the vertue and efficacie of the faythfull and feruent prayer, vſed in the miniſtration of this ſacrament of anoylynge, accordynge to the ſayenge of ſaynct Iames before reherſed, and alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the ſondry promiſes, made by Chryſte vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge wherof, two thynges be here ſpeciallye to be noted: The fyrſte is that ſaint Iames calleth here the prayer to be vſed in the tyme of this inunction, the prayer of fayth. wherby he meaneth, that this prayer oughte to be made in that righte faith, truſte, and confidence: whiche we ought to haue in god to obteyne the effect of our petitions made in the miniſtration of this ſacrament. and that it ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne nothynge, but that ſhall ſtande with the pleaſure, the honour, and glorie of god. and that whanne we directe our prayers vnto god for any bodili helth or reliefe, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall commoditie: we ought always to tempre our ſayd prayer with this condition, that is to ſaye, yf it ſhall ſoo ſtande with goddis wyll and his pleſure. And that we ought to ſaye, as Chriſte ſayd in his prayer vnto his father. Father yf it ſhall pleſe the: I am content to die and ſuffre this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and cruell death of the croſſe. Thy wyll be fulfylled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,<note place="margin">Mat. xxv</note> let not my wyll and deſire be folowed, but lette thy wylle and diſpoſition be fulfylled, wherunto I holly commyt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. </p>
               <p>¶ The ſeconde thynge to be noted is, that to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of the ſayde grace, conferred in this ſacramente of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vnction, it is expedient alſo, that the ſycke perſonne hym ſelfe ſhall knowledge his offences towardes god and his neyghboure, and aſke forgyuenes of them for the ſame. and lykewyſe forgyue all theym that haue offended hym in worde or dede. and ſo beynge in parfyte loue and charyte, to praye hym ſelfe (as he maye) with faythfull harte and full hope and confydence in god for the remyſſyon of his ſynnes, and reſtorynge vnto his bodyly helthe, yf it ſhall ſoo ſtande with goddes pleaſure. And therfore the ſayde apoſtle addeth immediatlye vnto this place theſe wordes folowynge, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe youre faltes and offences,<note place="margin">Iaco. v.</note> whiche ye haue treſpaſed one to an other, and be you redy and gladde to forgyue the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173220:56"/> for goddis ſake, and to aſke forgyuenes the one of the other, and ſo beynge reconciled, praye eche for other: and than you ſhall atteyne perfyt helth of all your infirmities, as well ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual as corporal. For yf you be ſo affected in hart, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and knitte the one to the other in perfite charitie: no doubt ye be iuſtified, in the ſight of god, and without doubte your prayer ſhal be herde and accepted of god. For ſurely the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the man iuſtified is of meruelous vertue and efficacie in the acceptation of god, as it appereth by the exaumple of Elias the prophete. who althoughe he were but a man, and ſubiecte to affections as other men be:<note place="margin">iii. Re. xvii. Luce. iiii.</note> yet bycauſe he was a iuſte man, whanne he prayed to god, that neyther rayne nor dewe ſhulde deſcende vpon the lande of Iſraell from heuen by the ſpace of thre yeres and ſyxe monethes, god graunted his prayer, and wold not ſuffre that any rayne or dewe ſhuld fall vpon the ſayde lande by the ſayde ſpace. whereby aroſe an extreme derthe and famyne amonges them of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And afterwarde whan the ſayd Elias prayed agayn to god to ſende rayne and moyſture vpon the ſayde ſande: God lykewyſe herde his prayer, and ſente downe rayne plenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vppon the erthe, and ſo the erthe brought forth all kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of fruite agayne, in lyke maner as it was wonte to doo before, to the great comforte of the peole.</p>
               <p>¶Finally, we thynke it conuenient, that all byſſhoppes and preachers ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theyr ſpirituall charge, Fyrſte, that no man oughte to thinke, that by the receyuinge of this ſacrament of anoyling, the ſicke mans lyfe ſhall be made ſhorter: but rather that the ſame ſhall be prolonged therby conſyderynge the ſame is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for recouerie of helthe both of the ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>Seconde that it is an euyll cuſtome to dyfferre the adminy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this ſacrament, vnto ſuche tyme, as the ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be brought by ſickenes vnto extreme perill and ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of lyfe, and be in maner in diſpayre to lyue any lenger.</p>
               <p>Thirdely that it is laufull and expedient to admyniſter this
<pb facs="tcp:173220:57"/> ſayd ſacrament vnto euery good chriſten man, in the maner and fourme before reherſed: ſoo ofte and when ſo euer any great and perillous ſicknes, and maladie ſhall fortune vnto them. For the trouth is, that the holy fathers of the churche dyd neither call this ſacrament, the extreme vnction (that is to ſaye, the laſte vnction) bycauſe it ſhulde be minyſtred laſte and after al other ſacramentes. neyther yet they dyd ordeine, that the ſame ſhuld be miniſtred onely, when ſycke men ſhuld be brought vnto the extreme panges of deth: but they dyd call it by the ſayd name of Extreme vnction, bicauſe it is the laſt in reſpecte of thother inunctions, whiche be miniſtred before in the other ſacramentes of baptiſme and confyrmation (In both whiche ſacramentes, chriſten men be alſo annoyled and annoynted.) And the trouthe is alſo, that the ſacramente of the Altare, beinge duely receaued, is the very ſpiritual foode, and the very neceſſarie ſuſtentation, comforte, and preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all chriſten men in all daungerous paſſages and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures. And therfore it is expedient, that the ſayde ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the altare ſhoulde be receyued after this annoylynge, done in the tyme of ſickneſſe. For ſurely the receauinge of the body of our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſte, is the very perfection, not onely of this, but alſo of all the other ſacramentes.</p>
               <p>And, as vnto the ordinance of the holy fathers, concerning the tyme, when this ſacrament of extreme vnction ſhulde be miniſtred and receaued: it is out of all doubte, that they wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordeyned, that the ſame ſhulde be obſerued, accordyng to the inſtitution of the apoſtle ſainct Iames. Whiche was, that it ſhulde be miniſtred and receyued, ſo ofte and whan ſo euer any man ſhulde fortune to be ſycke of any daungerous ſyckenes. and alſo at ſuche tyme as the ſicke man hym ſelfe were of perfyte remembraunce, iudgement, dyſcrecion, and knowlege, in ſuche thynges as do apperteyne vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and offyce of a good chriſten man. For (as it was ſayd before) ſaint Iames requireth ſuche Iudgement, ſuche ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affections, and motions, and alſo ſuche deſyre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173220:57"/> to be in the ſycke man: that he hym ſelfe, in the tyme of his anoyling, ſhuld not only hartily, faithfully, deuoutly, and religiouſly prayſe god, and thanke god for his viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; punyſhement: but alſo puttinge his hole confidence and truſte in god, and ſoo commyttynge hym ſelfe holly into his handes and mercy, ſhulde inuocate and call vppon hym for the remiſſion of his ſynnes, and recouerie of his helthe, and fynally ſhulde declare his charitie, in forgyuinge, and aſking of forgyuenes for all offences commytted by hym agaynſte his neyghbour, or by his neyghboure agaynſt hym.</p>
               <p>¶Thus beinge declared the vertue and efficacie of all the ſeuen ſacramentes, we thinke it conuenient, that al byſſhops and preachers ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theyr ſpirituall charge, that althoughe the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Matrimonye, of Confirmation, of holy Orders, and of Extreme vncton, haue ben of longe tyme paſte receaued, and approuid by the commune conſent of the catholique chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, to haue the name and dignitie of ſacramentes, as in dede they be well worthy to haue (foraſmoche as they be holy and godly ſygnes, wherby, and by the prayer of the miniſter, be not onely ſignyfied, and repreſented: but alſo gyuen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſome certayne and ſpecyal gyftes of the holy goſte, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for chriſten menne to haue for one godly purpoſe or other, lyke as it hath ben before declared) yet there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in dignitie and neceſſitie betwene them and the other thre ſacramentes, that is to ſaye, the ſacramentes of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, of Penance, and of the Altar, and that for diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               <head>The Expoſition of the fyrſte commaundement.</head>
               <p>THe fyrſte commaundemente, lyke as it is fyrſte in order, ſo it is the moſt chiefe, and princypall amonge al the other preceptes. For in this fyrſte commaundement, god requyreth of vs thoſe thynges, in the whiche conſyſteth his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173220:58"/> chiefe &amp; principal worſhyp and honour, that is to ſay, perfyte faith, ſure hope, &amp; vnfeyned loue, and drede of god. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as concernyng this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, we thynke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that all byſhops and prechers ſhal inſtructe and teache the people, committed vnto theyr ſpirituall charge, Fyrſt that to haue god, is not to haue hym, as we haue other outewarde thynges, as clothes vpon our backe, or treaſure in our che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, nor alſo to name hym with our mouthe, or to worſhyp hym with knelynge, or ſuche other geſtures: But to haue hym our god, is to conceyue hym in our hartes, to cleue faſte and ſurely vnto hym with harte and mynde, to putte all our truſte and confidence in hym, to ſette all our thoughte and care vpon hym, and to hange holly of hym, takynge hym to be infinitely good and mercyfull vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Seconde, that god commaundeth vs thus to do vnto hym only, and to no creature, nor to no falſe and fayned god. For as a kynde and louynge man canne not be content, that his wyfe ſhulde take any other huſbande: ſo can not out mooſte kynde, and mooſte louynge god, and creatour be pleaſed, yf we ſhoulde forſake hym, and take any other fayned goddis. And ſurely he is more preſent with vs, &amp; more redy to ſhewe vs all kyndnes and goodnes, than any creature is or can be. And allredye of his gyfte we haue all that we haue, meate, drynke, clothe, reaſon, wytte, vnderſtandynge, dyſcretion, and all good thynges, that we haue, perteynynge both to the ſowle and the bodye. And therfore he can not beare ſo moche vngratitude and vnkyndenes at our handes, that we ſhulde forſake hym, or elles fyxe our fayth and truſte in any other thynges beſydes hym.</p>
               <p>Thyrdely, that by this precepte god commaundeth vs, not onely to truſte thus in hym: but alſo to gyue hym the hole loue of our hartes aboue all worldly thynges, yea and aboue our ſelfes. So that we maye not loue our ſelfes, nor any other thynge, but for hym. accordynge as Moyſes ſayth in the boke of Deuteronomie, Thy lorde god is one god,<note place="margin">Deut. vi.</note> and
<pb facs="tcp:173220:59"/> thou ſhalt loue hym with all thy harte, and with all thy lyfe, and with al thy mynd, and with all thy ſtrength and power. And this loue muſte brynge with it a feare, that euen for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray pure loue we ought to be moche abaſhed, and afrayde, to breake the leaſt of his commaundementes: Lyke as the chylde the more he loueth his father, the more he is lothe and afrayde to dyſpleaſe hym in any maner of caſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthely, that all they offende agaynſt this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche ſette theyr hartes &amp; myndes vpon any worldly thynge aboue god. For what ſo euer we loue aboue god, ſo that we ſet our myndes vpon it, more than we do vpon god, or for it we woll offende god: truely that we make our god. For as ſayncte Paule ſayth,<note place="margin">Collo. iii. Philli. iii</note> The couetouſe man makethe his goodes, his god, and the gluttonous man maketh his bely his god. For the one ſetteth his mynde more vpon his goodes, the other more vpon his bely: than they doo vpon god, and for them they wolle not ſtycke to offend god. and all theſe breake this commaundemen.</p>
               <p>Item that all they, whiche haue more confidence in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures of god, than in god: doo alſo make the creatures of god, theyr god. And howe greuouſly god is offended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we fynde in the boke of Paralipomenon,<note place="margin">ii. Par. xvi.</note> where it is wrytten, That when Aza kyng of Iuda being ſore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Baaſa kynge of Iſraell, ſente for helpe to Benadad kyng of Siria, and gaue to hym great treaſure, for to allure hym to his ayde: Our lorde ſent the prophete Ananie to Aza the kynge of Iuda, who ſayde vnto hym in this maner, By<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt truſted in the kynge of Siria, and not in thy lorde god: therfore thoſe of the kynge of Siria, are eſcaped from thy handes. were not they of Ethiopia and Libia of farre greater power, bothe in chariottes and horſemenne, and in nombre or multitude, whiche was innumerable? And yet our lorde, as longe as thou dyddeſt put thy truſte in hym: dyd yelde them in to thy handes. The eies of god do beholde all the worlde, and doo gyue ſtrengthe to them that truſte in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173220:59"/> hym with all theyr harte. In whiche wordes it doth appere, that it is layed to Aza his chardge, that he dyd not beleue in our lorde, bycauſe he had more truſte in Benadad an hethen prynce, than in our lorde. It is noted alſo in the ſame chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That where as Aza afterwarde had veray great peyne in his feete, he ſought not to our lorde for remedy of his ſayde dyſeaſe: but truſted more in the arte and remedy of phiſique. Wherby we maye lerne, that it is one great parte of parfyte belefe in our lorde god, to put our truſt and confidence mooſt pryncypally, and aboue al other, in hym. Wherfore they that do otherwyſe, tranſgreſſe this commaundement, and make to them other goddis.</p>

For bothe theſe wayes they make hym no god, takynge from hym eyther iuſtyce or mercye, withoute whiche he can not be god. And ſo do they, that by ſuperſticion repute ſome dayes good, ſome diſmale, or infortunate: or thynke it a thyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky to mete in a mornynge with certayne kynde of beaſtis, or with men of certayne profeſſions. For ſuche ſuperſtitious folke infame the creatures of god.</p>
               <p>¶Item that they be of the ſame ſort, whiche by lottes, aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, diuination, chatterynge of byrdes, phiſiognomie, and lokynge of mennes handes, or other vnlaufull and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe craftes, take vpon them certaynely to tell, determyne, and iudge before hande of mennes actes and fortunes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be to come afterwarde. For what do they but make them ſelfes goddis in this behalfe, as the prophete Eſaie ſaythe?<note place="margin">Eſaie, xli</note> Telle vs afore, what ſhall comme, and we ſhall ſaye that you be goddis.</p>
               <p>¶Item that all they, whiche by charmes and wytchecraftes do vſe any preſcribed letters, ſygnes, or charactes, wordes,
<pb facs="tcp:173220:60"/> bleſſynges, roddes, criſtall ſtones, ſceptres, ſwordes, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, hanging of ſainct Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goſpell, or any other thynge about theyr neckes, or any other part of theyr bodies, or any other ſuche vayne obſeruation: truſtynge therby to contynue longe life, to driue away ſycknes, or preſerue them from ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fires, water, or any other peryl, other wyſe then phiſique or ſurgerie doth allowe, doo alſo offende agaynſte this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>

               <p>By theſe wordes we be vtterlye forbydden to make or to haue any ſymilitude or image, to the intent to bowe downe to it, or to worſhyp it. And therfore we thynke it conuenient, that all byſſhops and preachers, ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commytted to theyr ſpirituall charge, Fyrſt, that god in his ſubſtance can not by any ſimilitude or ymage be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented or expreſſed. For no wytte ne vnderſtandynge canne comprehende his ſubſtance. And that the fathers of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. conſyderynge the dulnes of mans wyt, and partely yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the cuſtome of gentylitie (whiche before theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge vnto the fayth of Chriſte had certayne repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theyr falſe goddis) ſuffred the pycture or ſimilitude of the father of heuen to be had and ſette vp in churches: not that he is any ſuche thynge, as we in that image do beholde (for he is no corporall ne bodyly ſubſtance) but onely to putte vs in remembrance, that there is a father in heuen, and that he is a diſtincte perſone from the ſonne, and the holy gooſte. whiche thing neuer the les, yf the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people wolde dewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceyue of the heuenly father, without any bodyly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: it were more ſemely for chriſten people, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſuche images of the father, than to haue any of them.</p>

As for an example. The image of our ſaluyour, as an open boke, hangeth on the croſſe in the rode, or is paynted in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, walles, or wyndowes, to the intent that beſide thexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of vertues, whiche we may lerne at Chriſte: we may be alſo many wayes prouoked to remembre his peynefull and cruel paſſyon, and alſo to conſydre our ſelfes, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the ſayde image, and to condempne and abhorre our ſynne, whiche was the cauſe of his ſoo cruell dethe. and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to profeſſe, that we wol no more ſynne. And furthermore, conſyderyng what hygh charitie was in hym, that wolde dye for vs his ennemies, and what great dangiers we haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and what hygh benefytes we receyue by his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we may be prouoked in all our dyſtreſſes and troubles, to runne for comforte vnto hym. All theſe leſſons, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mo, we may lerne in this boke of the Roode, yf we wol en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly and erneſtly loke vpon it. And as the lyfe of our ſauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſte is repreſented by this image: euen ſoo the lyues of the holy ſanctes, whiche folowed hym, be repreſented vnto vs by theyr images. And therfore the ſayde images may well be ſet vp in churches, to be as bokes for vnlerned people, to lerne therin examples of humylytie, charitie, pacience, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, contempte of the worlde, the fleſſhe, and the deuyll, and to lerne example of all other vertues, and for the other cauſes aboue reherſed. For whiche cauſes onely, images be to be ſette in the churche, and not for any honoure to be done
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173220:61"/> vnto them. For although we vſe to ſenſe the ſayde ymages, and to knele before them, and to offre vnto them, and to kyſſe theyr feete, and ſuche other thynges: yet we muſte knowe and vnderſtand, that ſuche thynges be not, nor oughte to be done to the ymages ſelfe, but onely to god, and in his honour, or in the honour of the holy ſaincte or ſainctes, whiche be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the ſayd ymages.</p>
               <p>¶Thyrdely, we thinke it conuenient, that all byſſhops and preachers ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr ſpirituall charge, that agaynſt this commaundment dyd offende generally before the comyng of Chriſte all genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp; people that were not of the nation of Iſraell. For they worſhipped images and falſe goddis, ſomme one, ſomme an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Of the whiche ſorte, there was a great nombre. For beſyde theyr common goddis, euery countrey, euery citie or towne, euery houſe and familie hadde theyr propre goddis. Wherof is moche mencyon made in authors bothe chriſten &amp; hethen. And theſe gentyles thoughe they had knowlege of a veray god: yet as ſaynt Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">Roma. i.</note> they had ydle and vayn fantaſyes, whiche ledde them from the trouthe: and where they counted them ſelfes wyſe, they were in dede very foles. </p>
               <p>¶ Item that agaynſt this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mundement alſo offended the Iewes many and ſondry tymes, and almooſte continually.

               <p>¶Finally we thynke it conuenient, that all byſſhoppes and preachers, ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commytted vnto theyr ſpirituall charge, that to ſette vp images, as the hethen people and the Iewes dyd, to bowe to theym, and to worſhyp them, is forbydden in this ſeconde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. </p>
               <p>¶ Item that all they do greatly erre, whiche put difference betwene ymage and ymage, truſtyng more in one then in an other: as thoughe one coude helpe, or do more than an other,
<pb facs="tcp:173220:62"/> when bothe do repreſent but one thyng, and ſauyng by way of repreſentation, neyther of them is hable to worke, or to do any thynge. And they alſo that be more redye with theyr ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to decke deed ymages gorgiouſly and gloriouſly: than with the ſame to helpe poore chryſten people, the quicke and lyuely images of god. Whiche is the neceſſarye worke of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by god. And they alſo, that ſo dote in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, that they make vowes, and go on pylgremages euen to the images, and there do calle vpon the ſame ymages for ayde and helpe: fantaſieng, that eyther the image wol worke, or els ſome other thynge in the image, or god for the images ſake. As though god wrought by images carued, engrauen, or peynted, brought ones into churches, as he dothe worke by other his creatures. In whiche thynges if any perſonne heretofore hath, or yet dothe offende: all good and well ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men haue great cauſe to lament ſuche errour and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to put theyr ſtudies and diligence for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame.</p>

Fyrſte that this worde Sabbote is an hebrewe worde, and ſignyfieth in englyſſhe reſte. So that the Sabbot daye is as moche to ſaye, as the daye of reſte and quyetnes. And therfore there is a ſpeciall &amp; notable difference betwene this commaundement and thother .ix. For, as ſainct Auſten ſayth, All the other .ix. commaundementes be morall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes, and belonged not onely to the Iewes, and all the other people of the worlde, in the tyme of the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but alſo to all chriſten people in the newe teſtament.

<pb facs="tcp:173220:65"/> Chriſte, and not for euery .vii. daye onely, but for all dayes, howres, &amp; tymes. For at all tymes we be bounde to reſt from fulfyllynge of our owne carnall wyll and pleaſure, from all ſynnes, and euyll deſyres, from pride, diſobedience, ire, hate, couetouſnes, and all ſuche corrupt &amp; carnal appetites, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this is the true Sabbotte or reſte of vs, that be chryſtened, when we reſte from our owne carnall wylles, and be not ledde therby: but be guyded alwaye by god and his holy ſpirite.

               <p>¶Seconde we thynke it conuenient, that all byſſhops and preachers, ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto theyr ſpyrytuall charge, that beſydes this ſpyrytuall reſte (whiche chiefely and pryncypally is requyred of vs) we be bounde by this precepte, at certayne tymes to ceaſſe from all bodyly labour, and to gyue our myndes entyerly and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto god. to here and lerne his worde. to knowledge our owne ſynfulnes vnto god, and his great mercy, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto vs. to gyue thankes vnto hym for all his benefytes. to make publyque and common prayer for all thynges nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. to receyue the ſacramentes. to viſite the ſycke. to inſtructe euery man his chyldren, and famylie in vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſuche other lyke workes.

And whan they haue ſo done, than let them clerely, and purely in their hartes remytte and forgyue all malyce and diſpleaſure, whiche they beate to any creature. And after that, then let them fall vnto prayer, accordynge to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Chriſte, where he ſayth,<note place="margin">Math. v.</note> whan you begynne to praye, forgyue what ſo euer diſpleaſure you haue ageynſt any man.

And they that can rede, maye be well occupied vpon the holy day, yf they rede vnto other, ſuch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che good workes, whiche maye be vnto them in ſtede of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.

               <p>And truely yf men wolde occupie them ſelfes vpon the holy dayes, and ſpende the ſame dayes holly, after this fourme and maner, not onely in the howſe of god, but alſo in their owne howſes: they ſhulde therby eſchewe moche vice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde their auncient ennemy the deuyll, moche edyfie both them ſelfes and other, &amp; finally obteigne moche grace, and hygh rewarde of almyghty god.</p>
               <p>¶Thyrdly we thynke it conuenient, that all byſhoppes and prechers ſhall inſtruct and teache the people, committed vnto theyr ſpirituall charge to haue ſpeciall regarde, that they be not ouer ſcrupulous, or rather ſuperſtitious in abſteynynge from bodily labour vpon the holyday. For not withſtanding al that is afore ſpoken, it is not ment, but that in tyme of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, we may vpon the holyday gyue our ſelfe to labour, as for ſauinge of our corne &amp; cattall, whan it is in daunger, or lykely to be diſtroyed, yf remedy be not had in tyme.

               <p>¶Item al they, whiche hauynge no laufull impediment, do not gyue them ſelfe vpon the holy daye to here the worde of god, to remembre the benefytes of god, to gyue thankes for the ſame, to praye, &amp; to exerciſe ſuche other holy workes, as be appoynted for the ſame: but (as commonly is vſed) paſſe the tyme eyther in idlenes, in glottony, in ryot, or in plays, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vayne and ydell paſtyme. For ſurely ſuche kepynge of the holy day is not accordyng to thintente and meanynge of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: but after the vſage and cuſtome of the Iewes. and doth not pleaſe god: but doth moche more offende hym, and prouoke his indignation, and wroth towardes vs. For as ſainct Auſten ſaythe of the Iewes, they ſhulde be better occupied labourynge in theyr feldes, and to be at the plough: than to be idle at home. And women ſhoulde better beſtowe theyr tyme in ſpynninge of wolle, than vpon the ſabot daye to loſe theyr tyme in leapyng and daunſynge, and other idle, wanton loſe tyme.</p>
               <p>Item that all they do offende agaynſt this commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whiche do here the worde of god, and gyue not good hede there vnto, that they maye vnderſtande it, and lerne it. or yf they do lerne it, yet they endeuour not them ſelfes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre it. or yf they remembre it, yet they ſtudy not to folowe it. </p>
               <p>¶ Item that all they do breake this commaundement alſo, whiche in maſſe tyme doo occupye theyr myndes with other matiers, and lyke vnkynde people remembre not the paſſion and deathe of Chriſte, nor gyue thankes vnto hym. Whiche thynges in the maſſe tyme they ought ſpecyally to do, for the maſſe is ordeyned to be a perpetuall memorie of the ſame. And lyke wyſe do all thoſe, whiche in ſuche tyme as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune prayers be made, or the worde of god is taught, not onely them ſelfes do gyue none attendaunce therto: but alſo by walkynge, talkynge and other euyll demeanour, let other that wolde well vſe them ſelfes. And lyke wyſe doo all they, whiche do not obſerue, but deſpyſe ſuche laudable ceremonies

               <p>¶And therfore concernynge ſuche ceremonyes of the churche, we thynke it conuenyent, that all byſſhoppes and preachers, ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commytted vnto theyr ſpirituall charge, that althoughe the ſayde ceremonies haue no power to remytte ſynne: yet they be very expediente thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to ſtirre and cauſe vs, to lyfte vp our myndes vnto god, and to put vs in contynuall remembraunce of thoſe ſpiritual thynges, whiche be ſygnyfied by them: As ſprinklyng of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water doth put vs in remembraunce of our baptyſme, and the blode of Chriſte, ſprinkeled for our redemption vpon the Croſſe. Gyuynge of holy breade doth put vs in remembrance of the ſacrament of the Altare, whiche we oughte to receyue in ryght charitie, and alſo that all chriſten men be one bodye myſticall of Chriſte, as the breade is made of many graynes, and yet but one lofe. Bearynge of candels on Candelmas daye doth put vs in remembraunce of Chriſte the ſpirituall lyghte, of whom Simeon dyd prophecie, as is redde in the churche that day. Gyuynge of aſhes on Aſhe wenyſday, doth put vs in remembraunce, that euery chryſten man, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge of lente and penaunce, ſhulde conſydre, that he is but Aſhes and erthe, and therto ſhall retourne. Bearynge of palmes on palmeſonday, dothe put vs in remembraunce of the receyunge of Chriſte into Hieruſalem a lyttell before his deth, and that we muſte haue the ſame deſire to receyue hym into our hartes. Crepynge to the croſſe, and humblynge our ſelfes to Chriſte on good fryday before the Croſſe, and there offerynge vnto Chriſte before the ſame, and kyſſynge of it, putteth vs in remembraunce of our redemption by Chriſte made vpon the croſſe. And ſo fynally the ſettynge vp of the ſepulture of Chryſte, whoſe body after his deathe was bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The halowynge of the Fonte, and other lyke exorciſmes &amp; benedictions done by the miniſters of Chriſtis churche, and all other lyke laudable cuſtomes, rytes, and ceremonies, doo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173220:67"/> put vs in remembraunce of ſome ſpirituall thynge. And that therfore they be not to be contemned, and caſt away: but be to be vſed and contynued as thynges good and laudable for the purpoſes aboueſayde.</p>

And in the boke of prouerbes the wyſe man alſo ſayth,<note place="margin">Prouer. xxviii.</note> He that ſtealeth any thynge from his father or mother, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a murderer.

For ſo moche as in the olde lawe, he dydde appoynte thervnto ſo greuous punyſhementes.</p>
               <p>And as almyghty god doth thretten theſe punyſſhementes vnto thoſe children, whiche do breake this commaundement: ſo he dothe promyſe great rewardes, to theym that kepe it. For he that honoureth his father (ſaith the wyſe manne) his ſynnes ſhall be forgyuen hym:<note place="margin">Eccle. iii.</note> And he that honoureth his mother, is as one that gathereth treaſure.

He that honoureth his father, ſhall haue a longe and a proſperous lyfe. And as the chyldren by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, be bound, to honour and obey theyr parentes (according as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) ſo it is implied in the ſame precept, that the parentes ſhulde noriſhe &amp; godly bryng vp theyr children, that is to ſay, that they muſt not only fynd them meate &amp; drinke in youth, &amp; alſo ſet them forward in lernyng, labour, or ſome other good exerciſe, that they may eſchew idlenes, and haue ſome craft, &amp; occupation, or ſome other laufull meane to get theyr liuinge: but alſo they muſte lerne &amp; teche them to truſte in god, to loue hym, to feare hym, to loue theyr neighbour, to hate no man, to hurt no man, to wiſhe wel to euery man, and ſo moch as they maye to do good vnto euery man, not to curſe, not to ſwere, not to be riottous, but to be ſobre &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate in al thingis, not to be worldly, but to ſette theyr myndes vpon the loue of god and heuenly thynges, more than vppon temporall thynges of his world, and generally to do al that is good, &amp; to eſchue all that is euyll. And this the parentes ought to do, not by cruel entreating of theyr chyldren, wherby they might diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, &amp; prouoke them to hate theyr parentes: but by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable rebukynge, thretenynge, and reſonable chaſtiſynge and correctynge of them, whan they do euyl: and cheryſhyng, maynteynynge, and commendynge them, whan they do wel.</p>
               <p>This offyce and duetie of the parentes towardes theyr chyldren is wytneſſed in many places of Scripture. Fyrſte ſaynt Paule wryteth thus, Fathers,<note place="margin">Ephe. vi.</note> prouoke not your chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnto angre, but brynge theym vp in the correction and doctrine of god. And in Deutero. Almyghtye god faythe,<note place="margin">Deut. vi. Pro. xxix.</note> Teache my lawes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes to thy children.

And in an other place he ſayth,<note place="margin">Pro. xiii.</note> He that ſpareth the rodde, hateth his ſonne: and he that loueth hym,

If thou ſtryke hym with the rodde, he ſhall not dye, thou ſhalte ſtryke hym with a rodde, and ſhalte therby dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his ſoule frome helle. And on the other ſyde it is wrytten, The ſonne vntaught &amp; vnchaſtyſed,<note place="margin">Eccl. xxii i. Reg. iiii</note> is the confuſyon of his father. And for this cauſe we fynde in the boke of kinges how that our lorde conceyued hyghe indignation ageynſt Helie the chiefe prieſt, bycauſe he dyd not duely correcte his two ſonnes Ophni &amp; Phinees, whan he knewe that they dyd greuouſly offend god.

This example of Helie is neceſſary for fathers to emprinte in theyr hartes, that they maye ſee theyr chyldren well taughte and corrected: leaſte they runne into the greate indignation of almyghtye god, as Helie dydde, and not onely in this worlde haue confuſion, but alſo in the worlde to come, haue dampnation for the myſorder of theyr chyldren throughe their defaute. And they muſte not thynke, that it is ynough to ſpeke ſomwhat vnto them, whan they do amys (For ſo dyd Helie to his ſonnes, and yet our lorde was not pleaſed, bycauſe he dyd not more ſharpely correcte them, and ſe them reformed) But whan wordes woll not ſerue, the fathers and mothers muſte put to correction, and by ſuche diſcipline ſaue theyr ſoules, or elles they ſhall anſwere to god for them. And truely they greatly deſerue the indignation of god, that, whan they haue receyued of hym chyldren, do not brynge them vp to his ſeruyce, but without regard what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of them, ſuffreth them to ren to the ſeruice of the diuell.</p>

For in this laſte precepte is forbydde al inwarde motion, deſire, delite, inclination, and affection vnto euyll. Whiche thynges be ſo roted &amp; planted in all vs the chyldren of Adam, euen from the fyrſte houre of our byrthe, that althoughe by the inſpiration of the holy gooſte, and the grace of god, gyuen vnto vs, we do entende neuer ſoo well, and wolde moſte gladly eſchewe al euyll: yet there remayneth in vs a diſpoſition, and redynes vnto ſuche thynges, as be contrarie to the wil and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of god. In ſo moche that yf the grace of god dyd not helpe vs, to ſtaye and reſyſte our owne noughtynes, and delyte vnto ſynne: the ſame our
<pb facs="tcp:173220:79"/> concupiſcence and naughtynes ſhulde be ſoo moche, that we ſhulde runne hedlynge in to all myſchyefe, and that at euery lyght occaſyon. our nature is ſo corrupte, and we be ſo farre from the perfyte obedience vnto goddes wyll, whiche we had in the ſtate of innocency, and yet ſtyll ought to haue. And of this corruption of our nature and redynes vnto yuell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth ſaint Paule in his epiſtle vnto the Romains,<note place="margin">Rom. vii</note> where he declareth at lengthe, that the nature of man is ſoo full of concupiſcence, and yuell affections: that no man dothe or can of hym ſelfe ſatiſfie, or fulfyll the lawe of god. And that the lawe condemneth all men, as tranſgreſſours. And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery man for his ſaluatyon, muſt haue refuge vnto the grace &amp; mercy of god, obteyned by our ſauyour Ieſu Chriſte. I knowe (ſayth ſaynct Paule) that in me, that is to ſaye, in my fleſſhe dwelleth no goodnes. For I haue a good wyl, but I fynde not howe to performe it. For I doo not that good thyng, whiche I wolde: but I do that yuell, whiche I wolde not. And yf I do that I wolde not: then it is not I that doo it, but ſynne that dwelleth in me. Thus fynde I by the lawe that whan I wolde do good, yuell is preſent with me. for I delyte in the lawe of god, as concernynge myne inwarde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but I ſee an other lawe in the partis of my body, whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth contynually ageynſt the lawe of my mynde, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth me vnto the lawe of ſynne, whiche is in the partes of my body.

For whan a manne deſyreth an other mans goodes, yf he can not haue them: than he falleth into enuy, and grutcheth agaynſt them, that haue ſuche goodes, and deſyreth euyll towardes them, and is gladde whan they haue loſſe or hurte.

               <p>¶Seconde it is to be noted, that all the workes of mercy, &amp; all good thynges, whiche we be bounde to do, and lykewyſe all ſynnes, whiche we be bounde to eſchewe and leue vndone: be ſufficiently conteyned and compriſed in theſe two tables.

               <p>Theſe be the wordes of Chriſte, wherin it is further to be noted, that to loue our lorde god with all our harte, ſoule, and mynde, is to ſette all our hole mynde and thought, to knowe hym, to honour hym to pleaſe hym, and to loue hym vnſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly aboue al other thynges in the worlde.

And in lyke maner, yf we loue god aboue all thinges: than do we loue hym aboue our neighbour, and ſo we woll for nothinge fulfyll the wylle of our neighbour agaynſte his wyll. and as the loue of god aboue all thynges ſhulde ſo kepe, directe, and guyde vs, that for no loue or pleaſure to our ſelfe, or to our neyghbour, we ſhulde wyllyngely tranſgreſſe the leaſte parte of any of the tenne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes: In lyke wyſe the hartie and feruent loue, that we ſhulde beare to our neighbour, as to our ſelfes, ſhulde preſerue and kepe vs, that we ſhulde not kylle hym, nor committe adultery with his wyfe, nor ſteale his goodes, nor beare falſe wytnes agaynſt hym, nor by any meanes do, ſpeke. or wyſhe any maner of yuell vnto hym, but we ſhulde with harte, tongue, and handes, wyſhe, ſpeake, and worke all goodnes towardes hym, as ſayncte Paule ſayth, He that loueth his neyghbour,<note place="margin">Rom. xiii.</note> hath fulfylled the lawe.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173220:82"/> god hath ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared vnto vs his wyl &amp; pleſure, aſwel what he wold haue vs to do, as what he wolde haue vs not to do. The ſeconde conſideration is, for that we may know hereby our infirmitie, ſinne, and damnation. For whan we loke erneſtely vppon theſe commaundementes of god, and conſider what thyngis god requireth of vs in them: we ſhall ſe our ſelues as in a myrrour or glaſſe, &amp; ſhall eaſely perceyue, howe far we be from the true &amp; perfyt obſeruyng of the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes. &amp; ſo we ſhall perceyue our owne defautes, our owne myſerie, noughtynes,<note place="margin">Roma. iii.</note> &amp; our owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate, as ſaynt Paule ſayth, By the lawe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes we may knowe our ſynnes. The thyrde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is, for that by theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes, we may alſo attayne the knowledge of goddis mercye. For whan we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, that of our ſelfes we haue no ſtrenght, goodnes, or liefe eternall, but weakenes, ſyynne, and euerlaſtinge death: than we maye euidently ſe, howe moche nede we haue of the mercy of god, and to haue a ſauiour and redemer to paye a raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for our ſynnes and to delyuer vs from euerlaſtynge ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiuitie, damnation, and deathe, due vnto vs for the ſame. And therfore ſaynt Paule ſayth, The lawe was our ſchoole mayſter, conductour, and leader vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gala. iii.</note> that we myght be iuſtified by faythe, that is to ſaye, by goodis mercy, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Chriſt obteyned for vs.</p>
               <p>¶Fiftely it is to be noted, that althoughe theſe lawes and commaundementes of god, teache vs, what is good, and what we ſhulde do to pleaſe god: yet they gyue not vnto vs ſtrength and power to do the ſame: but all ſuche ſtrength co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of god, by his ſinguler grace, and gyft. And therfore as almyghty god taught vs by his prophete Moyſes, what we ſhulde do: ſo he taught vs by his ſonne Ieſu Chriſte, what we ſhulde aſke.

For ſurely no prayer is thankefull vnto god,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173220:84"/> but that, whiche ſpryngeth frome the harte. And therfore the prophete Dauid cryeth to our lorde with all his harte. And Moyſes is noted to crie out alowde, whan he ſpake no worde with his mouthe: but he ſpake alowde in his harte.<note place="margin">Eſai. xxix Mat. xv.</note> And our lorde by his prophete noteth, that ſome praye with theyr lyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and in theyr harte mynde nothynge leſſe than that, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they praye for. And therfore who ſo euer entendeth by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of this <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> to attayn that he deſyreth in the ſame, he muſte fyrſt here hym ſelfe, and vnderſtande what he ſayth, and ſo conioyne the worde of his mouth with the ſame worde in his harte, and ſay, as the prophete Dauid ſayd,<note place="margin">Pſal. lxx. et.

                  <p>Thyrdely, that all chriſten men ought to conceyue great comforte, and ioye in that they be taught and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in this prayer, to take almyghty god for theyr father, and ſo to calle hym. If our ſoueraygne lorde the kynge wolde ſaye to any of vs, take me for your father, and ſo calle me: what ioye in harte, what comforte, what confidence, wolde we conceyue of ſo fauourable and gracious wordes? Moche more than incomparably haue we cauſe to reioyſe, that the kynge and prince of al princes ſheweth vnto vs this grace and goodnes, to make vs his chyldren. And ſurely as the naturall ſonne may aſſuredly truſt, that his father wol do for hym, al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that may be for his ſettynge forthe, and auauncement: euen ſo we maye vndoubtedly aſſure our ſelfes, that hauyng almyghty god to our father, we ſhall lacke nothyng, neyther in this worlde, nor in the worlde to come, whiche may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable and expedyent for vs towardes the euerlaſtyng enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, whiche our heuenly father hath prepared for vs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthely, that lyke as this worde <hi>Father</hi> declareth the great beneuolence, mercy, &amp; loue of god towardes vs: ſoo it admonyſſheth vs agayn of our duetie towardes hym, &amp; howe
<pb facs="tcp:173220:85"/> we be bounde to ſhewe agayn vnto him our hole harty loue, and our obedyence, and redynes to fulfyll all his preceptes, and commaundementes with al gladnes and humilitie. And therfore who ſoo euer preſumethe to come to god with this prayer, and to call hym <hi>Father,</hi> and yet hath not full entente and purpoſe to vſe hym ſelfe in all thynges lyke a kynde and an obedyente ſonne: he commeth to hym as Iudas came to Chriſte with a kyſſe, pretendynge to be his frende and his ſeruaunt in callynge hym mayſter, and yet he was in dede a traytour to hym, and a deadely ennemie. And for this conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration euery chryſten manne, that entendeth to make this peayer, ought inwardely and throughoutly to enſerche and examyne hym ſelfe. And if he fynde in hym ſelfe any notable cryme,<note place="margin">Luc. xv.</note> for the whiche he maye be aſhamed to call god his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let hym accuſe hym ſelfe therof to god, and recognyſe his vnworthynes, ſayinge as the prodygall ſonne ſayde: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I haue offended the, I am not worthy to be called thy ſonne. And with intiere repentaunce, and with ferme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and entente to amende his noughty lyfe, let hym lyfte vp his harte vnto his celeſtiall father, And let hym call for his grace of reconciliation: and then lette hym boldely ſaye this <hi>Pater noſter.</hi>
                  </p>

And that therfore we ought not onely to be of one ſpyryte towardes our ſayde father,<note place="margin">Ephe iiii.</note> &amp; to employ and endeuour our ſelfes to the vttermoſte to pleſe hym, and to kepe his lawes and commaundementes: but we ought alſo eche to conſente with other in parfyte loue

                  <p>¶Sixtely by theſe wordes, <hi>whiche arte in heuen,</hi> we be taught that we ought to haue, not onely an inwarde deſyre, and a great care and ſtudie to come to that place, where our heuenly father is: but alſo an inwarde ſorowe and griefe, that we be ſo longe kepte frome the preſence of oure heuenly father, and be ſubiecte here vnto ſo manyfolde cures and thoughtes, to ſo many troubles and miſerie, and to ſo many, and ſo greuous perylles and daungers of the worlde, of ſynne, and of the dyuell. For lyke as a louynge chylde is euer deſyrous to be where his father is, &amp; yf his father ſhall departe to any place, he woll lamente and be ſorye, oneles he maye go with hym, and in his abſence he woll morne, and at his retourne he woll be ioyfull: euen ſo ought we deſyre euer to be with oure he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father.

Whiche (yf the grace of god helpe vs not, and we alſo applie not al our forces to mortifie and ouercome the ſame) no doubte woll ſoo ouergrowe the hoole gardeyne of our harte, that there ſhall be lefte no good herbe therin, but it ſhalbe ſo ouergrowen with the loue of our ſelfe and of this worlde, that the loue of god and our neyghbour ſhall conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually decay from tyme to tyme, and at length it ſhal grow, not onely to a neglygence and a ſmall regardynge: but alſo vnto an vttter contempte bothe of god and of our neighbour, and than we ſhall appertayne holly vnto the citie of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. For as ſaynct Auguſtine ſayth, There be in this worlde two cities, the one buylded by god, in the whiche he reygneth as a mooſt gracious lorde and kynge: The other is buylded by the dyuel, wherin the dyuel reigneth as a mooſt mercyleſſe and cruell tyranne.

For it is he that gyueth vnto vs, and taketh from vs, at his pleaſure more or leſſe.

For yf he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyde ſufficiently for all fyſſhes and byrdes, and other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, whiche laboure not for theyr lyuynge as we doo, howe moche more oughte we, beynge his owne chyldren, and alſo vſynge all labour and diligence to get our lyuynges, to truſt that our father, whiche hathe all thynges in his diſpoſition, wyll ſe vnto vs, that we ſhall lacke nothyng neceſſarie?

For our ſauyoure Chriſte ſaythe in the goſpell,<note place="margin">Matt, ix,</note> I ſaye to you be not carefull for your lyuynge, what you ſhall eate, ne what clothes you ſhall weare. Is not lyfe better than your meate, and youre bodye better than your clothynge?

Loke vpon the lillies in the fyelde, they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173220:90"/> labour not, they ſpynne not, and yet I tell you, that Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all his precious and royall apparell was not ſoo clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed as one of them. Therfore care you not for theſe thynges. Leaue this care to them, that knowe not god. Youre heuenly father knoweth, that you haue nede of all theſe thynges. but ſeke you fyrſt the kyngdome of god, and his ryghtuouſnes: &amp; than god ſhall caſt all theſe thynges vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be the wordes of Chriſte, full of good and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leſſons, that we ſhulde not care, ne ſette our hartes to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vpon theſe worldly thynges: ne care ſoo moche for to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, that we ſhall ſeme to myſtruſte our lorde. And that we ſhulde ſequeſter this care frome vs, and ſeeke for the kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of god, and employe our ſelfes holly, to the gettynge therof: and than he maketh a comfortable promyſe, that we ſhall not lacke thynges neceſſary for vs. And althoughe our lorde hath ſoo prouyded for ſome, that they haue all redy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and plentie for many days or yeres: yet that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge they ought to make this petition to god, and ſay, Gyue vs this daye our dayly breade. For aſmoche as theyr ſubſtaunce (thoughe it be neuer ſo great) lyke as it coulde not haue ben gotten without god hadde ſent it: ſo it can not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere and contynue, excepte god preſerue it. For howe many great ryche men haue we knowen ſodeynly made pore, ſome by fyre, ſome by water, ſome by thefte, ſome by exchete, and many other wayes? Was not Iob the one daye, the rycheſt man that was in all the Eſtlande: and the morowe after had vtterly nothynge? It is therfore as nedefull to pray our lorde to preſerue that, he hath gyuen vs: as to praye hym to gyue it. For yf he gyue it, and doo not preſerue it: we ſhall haue no vſe of it.</p>
                  <p>¶Fourthely, that by this breade, whiche oure ſauyoure tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to aſke in this petytyon, is pryncypally mente the worde of god, whiche is the ſpirituall breade, that fedeth the ſoule. For as the body is nouryſſhed, broughte vp, groweth, and fedeth with breade and meate: ſoo nedeth the ſoule euen
<pb facs="tcp:173220:91"/> from our youth to be nouriſſhed &amp; brought vp with the worde of god, and to be fed dayly with it. And lyke as the body wol faynte and decay, yf it be not from tyme to tyme releued and refreſſhed with bodyly ſuſtenaunce, euen ſo the ſoule waxeth feble and weake towardes god, oneles the ſame be contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cheryſſhed,<note place="margin">Mat. iiii.</note> refreſſhed, &amp; kepte vp with the worde of god, accordynge to the ſayinge of Chriſte. A man lyueth not with meate only, but by euery word that procedeth from the mouth of god. And ſurely there is no other thynge that can fede and comforte the ſoule, but onely this breade of the worde of god. For if we haue aduerſitie in this worlde, as pouertie, ſycknes, impriſonment, and ſuche other myſeries, where ſhulde we ſeke for comforte, but at goddis wordes? yf we thynke our ſelfe ſo holy, that we be without ſynne, where ſhuld we fynd a glaſſe to ſe our ſynnes in, but in the worde of god? If we be ſo ful of ſynnes, that we be lyke to fall in to deſperation, where canne we haue comforte, and lerne to knowe the mercy of god, but onely in goddes worde? Where ſhall we haue armure to fyght agaynſte our thre great ennemies, the worlde, the fleſſhe, and the dyuell, where ſhall we haue ſtrengthe and power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande them, but onely as Chriſte dyd in and by the worde of god? And fynally if we haue any maner of ſicknes or diſeaſe, in oure ſowles, what medicine or remedy can we haue, but onely the worde of god? So that the worde of god is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray breade of the ſoule. And therfore as well for this breade of the ſoule, as alſo for the breade and dayly ſuſtenaunce of the body, oure ſauyoure Chriſte teacheth vs to praye in this fourthe petition.</p>

But whan this dettour came vnto the kynge, and prayed hym on his knees, to haue pacience with hym, promyſynge hym to paye all: the kynge had pytie of hym, and forgaue hym the hole dette. It fortuned afterwarde, that this man, being thus acquited, met with an other of his felowes, that ought hym but an hundred pence, and with violence almooſt ſtrangled hym, and ſayd to hym. Pay me my money. And the ſayd ſeruaunt his felowe fel vpon his knees, and prayde hym to haue pacience, promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng to pay al. albe it he wolde not, but caſt hym into priſon, vntyll all was payde. And whan the reſt of theyr felowes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge this crueltie, had tolde the kynge therof: the kynge forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſent for this cruell felowe, and ſayd to hym, O wycked man, I forgaue the thy hole det, at thy ſuite and requeſt: It ſhulde therfore haue beſemed the, to haue ſhewed lyke compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon to thy felowe, as I had ſhewed to the.

                  <p>Thus it appereth playnly, that yf we woll be forgyuen, if we woll eſcape euerlaſtynge damnation: we muſt hartily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue thoſe, whiche haue treſpaſſed and offended agaynſt vs. No man can offende vs ſoo moche, as we offende god: and yet he is alwaye redy to forgyue vs. What ingratitude is it than, what hardenes of harte, what cruelnes is in vs, yf we
<pb facs="tcp:173220:93"/> for his ſake woll not forgyue one an nother? There is none offence great, that man dothe to man: yf it be compared to our offences agaynſt god.

Why do we boſte vs to be chryſten men, yf we care not for Chriſte, of whom we be ſoo named, yf we endeuoure not our ſelfe to take example at him? we be not worthy to haue the name of the membres: yf we folowe not the heed. And if any wol ſay, that his ennemie is not worthy to be forgyuen: let hym con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyder, and thynke, that no more is he worthy to haue forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of god. And by what equitie or iuſtyce can we requyre, that god ſhulde be mercyfull vnto vs, yf we woll ſhewe noo mercy, but extremytie vnto our neyghbour and brother? Is it a great matter for one ſynner to forgiue an other ſeing that Chriſte forgaue them that crucified hym? And althoughe thy ennemie be not worthy to be forgyuen: yet we be worthye to forgyue. And Chriſte is worthye, that for his ſake we ſhulde forgyue. But ſurely it is aboue our frayle and corrupte na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to loue our ennemies, that doo hate vs, and to forgyue them that do hurte and offende vs. Thus to do is a greatter grace tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can come of our ſelfes. Therfore our ſauiour Chriſt teacheth vs to aſke this heuenly gyfte of our heuenly father, that we may forgyue our ennemies, and that he wol forgiue
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173220:93"/> vs our treſpaſſes, euen ſo as we forgyue them, that treſpaſſe agaynſt vs.</p>
                  <p>¶Thyrdly, that to forgyue oure brother his defaulte, is to praye to our lorde, that he woll forgyue hym, and woll not impute his offence to hym: &amp; to wyſſhe to hym the ſame grace and glorie, that we deſyre vnto our ſelfes, and in no caſe to anoye hym, but whan occaſyon ſhall come, to helpe hym, as we be bounde to helpe our chriſten brother.</p>
                  <p>¶Fourthly, that none ennemye can wyſſhe or deſyre more hurte vnto vs, than we deſyre vnto our owne ſelfes, whan we offre vnto god this fyfthe petition: yf we woll not remyt and forgyue our dyſpleaſure vnto them, whiche offende vs. For what ennemye was euer ſoo malicious, or ſo farre from all grace and humanitie, that wolde deſyre and dayly praye to god, to ſende vnto his ennemye eternall damnation, and that god ſhulde withdrawe his mercy from hym for euer? And ſurely in this petition we aſke continually theſe thynges of god, for our ſelues, if we wol be mercyles towardes our enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and wyll not forgyue them theyr treſpaſſes. For none otherwyſe we do aſke forgyuenes of god. but vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. that we ſhall forgyue them, whiche treſpaſſe agaynſt vs. And in caſe we doo not fulfyll this condycyon: than we praye vnto god, that he ſhall neuer ſhewe mercy vnto vs, nor neuer forgyue vs oure ſynnes, but ſuffre vs to be dampned perpetually.</p>

And with this maner of temptation, god tempted ſondrye wyſe our holy father Abraam.

And for this purpoſe, as ſaynct Luke in his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell reporteth. In the ſyxte moneth after ſayncte Eliſabeth was conceyued with ſaynct Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Baptiſt, the aungell Gabriel was ſente from god into a Citie of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin, whiche was deſpouſed or enſuted to a man, whoſe name was Ioſeph, of the houſe of Dauid, and the virgins name was, <hi>Marie.</hi> And whan this aungel came vnto this ſayde virgin, he ſayde theſe wordes, <hi>Hayle full of grace, the lorde is with the, bleſſed arte thou amonge women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when the virgin, heryng theſe wordes was moche trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with them, &amp; muſed with her ſelfe, what maner of ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it ſhulde be, The aungel ſayd to her, Feare not Mary, be not abaſſhed: for thou haſte founde fauour and grace in the ſyght of god. Lo thou ſhalte conceyue in thy wombe, &amp; ſhalte brynge forth a ſonne: and thou ſhalte call his name Ieſus. he ſhalbe great: and ſhall be called the ſonne of the hygheſt, And the lorde god ſhall gyue to hym the ſete of Dauid his father, and he ſhall reygne ouer the houſe of Iacob for euer, and his kyngdome ſhall haue no ende. Then ſayd Mary to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, howe can this be done: for I knowe no man?

                  <p>¶Seconde, that the aungell Gabryell, whiche ſpake to the virgin, was an hygh aungell, and an hygh meſſanger. And truely it was conuenient, that he ſhulde be ſoo. For he came with the hygheſt meſſage, that euer was ſente, whiche was the treate and leage of peace betwene god &amp; man. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fyrſte worde of his ſalutation (that is to ſay, Hayle, or be ioyfull) was meruaylous conuenient for the ſame. for he came with the meſſage of ioye, And ſo ſayd the other aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, whiche at the byrthe of our ſauyoure appered to the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardes.

Theſe be ſuche matters of ioye and comforte to vs, that there neuer was or ſhallbe, nor canne be any lyke. But not onely for this purpoſe, he beganne with this hyghe worde of comforte: but alſo for that he perceyued, that the virgin beynge alone, wolde be moche abaſſhed and aſtonyed
<pb facs="tcp:173220:98"/> at his meruaylous and ſodayne commynge vnto her. And therfore he thought it expedient, fyrſt of al to vtter the worde of ioye and comforte, whiche myght comforte and put away al feare from the bleſſed virgyn. And he calleth not her by her propre name: but gyueth her a newe name, callynge her full of grace. This is nowe her newe name. and this is the higheſt name, that can be in any creature. For her ſonne, the ſonne of god, was contente with this name, where he is by the holy euangeliſt ſaynct Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called alſo full of grace. And yet ſhe is not in this behalfe equall with hym. For that ſhe is full of grace, ſhe hath it of hym.

For ſurely our lorde is not with them that be not in grace: he can not tarye with them, that be voyde of grace, and be in ſynne. For there is a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diuorce betwene the ſynfull ſowle and our lorde, as the wyſe man ſayth, Peruerſe thoughtes make a ſeparation and diuorce from god:<note place="margin">Sapie. i.</note> moche more peruerſe dedes.</p>
                  <p>¶Fourthely, that theſe wordes, Bleſſed arte thou amonge women, was menie, that there was neuer woman ſo bleſſed. And truely ſhe may wel be called ſo, mooſt bleſſed amongeſt all women: for ſhe had great and hyghe prerogatiues, whiche none other woman euer had, hath, or ſhall haue. Is not this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173220:98"/> an hygh prerogatiue, that of all women ſhe was choſen to be mother to the ſonne of god? And what excellent honour was ſhe put to, whan not withſtandynge the decree was made of his natiuitie by the hole trinitie: yet the thyng was not done and accomplyſſhed, without or before her conſent was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the which ſo ſolemne a meſſanger was ſent? And how hygh grace was this, that after the defaulte made throughe the perſwaſion of the fyrſt woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our mother Eua (by whom Adam was broughte in to dyſobedience) this bleſſed virgin was electe, to be the inſtrument of our reparation, in that ſhe was choſen to beare the ſauyour and redemer of the worlde? And is not this a wonderfull prerogatiue, to ſee a virgin to be a mother: and agaynſte the generall ſentence of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Eua, to conceyue &amp; brynge forthe her chylde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſynne? And who can eſteme, that meruaylous ſolace and comforte, whiche was in her harte, whan ſhe enbraced that chylde, and nouryſſhed it with her pappes, &amp; had contynually company of ſuche a ſonne ſo many yeres togyther? Wherfore we may worthyly ſay, that ſhe is the mooſt bleſſed of al other women. And to the intent that all good chriſten men ſhulde repute and take her ſoo: beholde the prouidence of god, that wolde by an nother witneſſe confirme the ſame. For euen the ſame wordes that the aungell ſpake, the bleſſed matron ſaint Eliſabeth ſpake alſo. and where the aungell made an ende, there ſhe began. The aungell made an ende of his ſalutation with theſe wordes, <hi>Bleſſed arte thou among women.</hi> The bleſſed matrone began her ſalutation with the ſame wordes, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng that ſhe was enſpired with the ſame ſpirite, that ſent the aungel: &amp; that they were bothe miniſters of the hole Trinitie, the one from heuen, the other in erthe. And afterwarde ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe wordes and ſayd, <hi>And bleſſed is the fruict of thy wombe.</hi> Theſe be not the wordes of the aungell: but of ſaynct Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. For whan the virgin Marie came to ſalute her, the ſayd Eliſabeth beyng inſpired with the holy gooſt, and knowyng that the virgin Marie was conceyued, ſpake theſe wordes of
<pb facs="tcp:173220:99"/> the fruict, that the virgin ſhulde brynge forthe. And here is alſo an other wonderfull thynge to be noted. for as it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the goſpell, the chylde in ſaynt Eliſabethes wombe, that is to ſaye ſaynct Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche yet had ſcant lyfe, gaue teſtimony to this fruict: that this fruict ſhulde ſaue hym, and all the worlde, and as a prophete, he lepte for ioye in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bealy. And althoughe he coulde not yet ſpeake: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the leſſe he declared by ſuche ſygnes and tokens, as he coulde: that bleſſed was the fruict of that wombe. This is the fruict, that the aungell ſpake of, ſayinge his name ſhall be Ieſus, that is to ſaye a Sauyoure: for he ſhall ſaue his people from theyr ſynnes. And well he may be called the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruict, whiche hathe ſaued vs, and geuen vs lyfe, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to the curſed fruict, whiche Eue gaue to Adam, by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we were dyſtroyed and brought to deathe: but bleſſed is the fruict of this wombe, whiche is the fruict of lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtynge.</p>
                  <p>¶Fifthely we thynkh it conuenient, that all byſſhoppes and preachers ſhall inſtructe and teache the people, commytted vnto theyr ſpirituall charge, that this <hi>Aue Maria</hi> is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely a prayer, as the pater noſter is. For a prayer proprely hath wordes of petition, ſupplication, requeſt and ſuite: but this <hi>Aue Maria</hi> hath no ſuche. Neuer the leſſe the churche hath vſed to adioyn it to the ende of the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> as an hymne, laude, and prayſe partly of our lord and ſauyour Ieſu Chriſt for our redemption, and partely of the bleſſed virgin, for her humble conſent gyuen and expreſſed to the aungell at this ſalutation. Laudes, prayſes, and thankes be in this Aue Maria principally gyuen and yelded to our lorde, as to the auctour of our ſayd redemption: but herewith alſo the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin lacketh not her laudes, prayſe, and thankes for her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſynguler vertues, and chiefely for that ſhe humbly conſented, accordynge to the ſayinge of the holy matron ſaynt Eliſabeth, when ſhe ſayde vnto this virgin, Bleſſed arte
